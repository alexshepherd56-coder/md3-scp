    <h1>Case 20.6 – Lower Respiratory Tract Infections - Pneumonia</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Children & Young People / Respiratory & ENT Systems | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Paediatrics Medicine | <strong>Setting:</strong> Emergency Department</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Michael Pancirov, is a 6 year old boy who presents with cough, fever and shortness of breath. He has been unwell for a few days with coryzal symptoms and temperature.</p>
    <p>On arrival: Looks unwell,<br>
    Temp. 39⁰C, RR 30bpm, with grunting, HR 120 bpm. SaO₂ – 90% [room air].</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. You are concerned that Michael has pneumonia, outline the key clinical features of your history and examination that would support a diagnosis of pneumonia.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Symptoms include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Dyspnoea</li>
          <li>Fever</li>
          <li>Malaise</li>
          <li>Cough may be dry or moist (but is not always present)</li>
          <li>Pleuritic chest pain is often present</li>
          <li>Neck pain (if apices involved, can be confused with meningism) the diaphragmatic pleural surface is involved</li>
          <li>Abdominal or shoulder tip pain (if diaphragmatic pleural surface involved)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Signs include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tachypnoea and respiratory distress,</li>
          <li>Dullness to percussion</li>
          <li>Auscultation: localized crackles and bronchial breathing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Of these signs, tachypnoea is the most consistent and reliable, and pneumonia should be suspected in any child with an unexplained tachypnoea.)</p>

        <h3>Signs of complications of pneumonia include those related to:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pleural effusion</strong> - shifting of mediastinum or trachea, dullness to percussion (stony dullness with large effusions), reduced or absent breath sounds, and bronchial breathing above the effusion</li>
          <li><strong>Pneumothorax</strong> - uncommon, shifting of mediastinum or trachea, reduced breath sound</li>
        </ul>

      <strong>3. Michael undergoes a CXR – Describe the radiological features of bacterial pneumonia, how does this differ from pneumonia due to mycoplasma pneumoniae and viral pneumonia.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Chest radiography is the most reliable investigation. If the chest radiograph is normal, pneumonia can be considered to be not present at that time, but, if the X-ray is taken very early in the disease process, this does not preclude radiological changes developing later.</p>

        <p>In general, (specificity of these changes is relatively poor)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>patchy or peripheral consolidation may be more in keeping with a viral infection</li>
          <li>lobar opacification is suggestive of bacterial pneumonia</li>
          <li>more central peribronchial infiltrate may indicate <em>Mycoplasma</em> infection</li>

      <strong>5. Viruses are more commonly the cause of pneumonia in children; outline the risk factors for viral pneumonia.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Risk factors for viral pneumonia include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age.</strong> Children under 5 years of age are at greatest risk of viral pneumonia, but the risk remains high throughout the first decade of life</li>
          <li><strong>Season.</strong> Peak seasonal incidence is in winter</li>
          <li><strong>Passive smoke exposure.</strong> Maternal smoking increases the risk, especially in the first year of life</li>
          <li><strong>Poor socioeconomic status.</strong> A risk factor in both the developing and the developed worlds</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-existing chronic problems.</strong> The risk is increased in chronic chest problems such as cystic fibrosis, chronic post neonatal lung disease, congenital heart disease and HIV infection.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. Summarise the main pathogens and clinical features of viral pneumonia in children.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The most important causative viruses are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>parainfluenza viruses</li>
          <li>influenza viruses</li>
          <li>respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</li>
          <li>adenoviruses</li>
          <li>human metapneumovirus (HMV)</li>
          <li>rhinoviruses</li>
          <li>cytomegalovirus (CMV)</li>
          <li>measles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of these viruses can cause other respiratory illnesses apart from pneumonia, including acute upper respiratory tract infection, acute laryngotracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Symptoms of these illnesses can co-exist with those of pneumonia.</p>

        <p>The radiological features of viral pneumonias are non-specific, but patchy, widespread infiltrates are more characteristic than lobar involvement. Treatment with antiviral agents is rarely indicated in normal children, but supportive measures are commonly required.</p>
