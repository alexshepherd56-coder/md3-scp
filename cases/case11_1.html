      <div class="answer">
        <h3>General Principles</h3>
        <p><strong>Adults</strong> with a symptomatic inguinal hernia should be offered surgery. Open mesh repair or laparoscopic repair aims to reduce post-operative pain to a minimum, enabling most procedures to be undertaken as day cases. Inguinal hernias can be controlled by a truss, but this is uncomfortable and is now seldom indicated, as repair using local or regional anaesthetic techniques can be employed in higher-risk patients.</p>

        <p><strong>Children:</strong> The identification of an inguinal hernia in any child is <em>always</em> an indication to operate. In newborns, the procedure must be carried out with some urgency because of the risk of strangulation. In very premature infants, the procedure may need to be done under regional block alone, and where general anaesthesia is used, elective post-operative ventilation may be required. In older children, elective surgery is usually undertaken on a day-case basis, with liberal use of local anaesthetic blocks for post-operative pain relief.</p>

        <h3>Surgical Techniques</h3>
        <p><strong>Lichtenstein Open Tension-Free Repair</strong> (most common):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insertion of synthetic mesh underneath the spermatic cord</li>
          <li>Mesh secured to:
            <ul>
              <li>Aponeurotic tissue overlying pubic bone (medially)</li>
              <li>Inguinal ligament (inferiorly)</li>
              <li>Internal oblique aponeurosis and conjoint tendon (superiorly)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Laterally, mesh is divided and wrapped around spermatic cord and sutured in place</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Laparoscopic Hernia Repair</strong> (increasing in popularity):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses pre-peritoneal approach</li>
          <li>Involves excising or reducing hernial sac and inserting mesh</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Femoral Hernias:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Particularly likely to obstruct and strangulate</li>
          <li>Surgical intervention indicated</li>
          <li>Can be repaired under local or general anaesthesia</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Management of Complicated Hernia</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Irreducibility</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Obstruction</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Strangulation</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Management approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If onset of symptoms was <strong>less than 6 hours</strong> prior to presentation, a gentle attempt to reduce hernia can be made, if patient unable to reduce themselves</li>
          <li><strong>Urgent operation indicated</strong> for all obstructed hernias, as one can never be certain that strangulation is not present</li>
          <li>Hernial sac is opened and contents inspected carefully</li>
          <li>If viable, contents returned to abdominal cavity and hernia repaired</li>
          <li>If doubt about viability of bowel or omentum, devitalized tissue must be resected before proceeding to repair</li>

      <strong>5. Summarise the key findings of the Cochrane review that compared outcomes of hernia repair comparing mesh versus non-mesh repairs.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Cochrane Review 2018 - Mesh versus Non-Mesh Repairs:</strong></p>

        <p>The authors conclude:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Compared to non-mesh repairs, mesh repairs <strong>probably reduce the rate of hernia recurrence</strong>, and reduce visceral or neurovascular injuries, making mesh repair a common repair approach. Mesh repairs may result in a <strong>reduced length of hospital stay</strong> and <strong>time to return to activities of daily living</strong>, but these results are uncertain due to variation in the results of the studies. Non-mesh repair is <strong>less likely to cause seroma formation</strong> and has been favoured in low-income countries due to low cost and reduced availability of mesh materials. Risk of bias in the included studies was low to moderate and generally handled well by study authors, with attention to details of allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Summary of Key Points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mesh repairs:</strong> Lower recurrence rate, fewer visceral/neurovascular injuries</li>
          <li><strong>Mesh repairs:</strong> May reduce hospital stay and return to activities (uncertain)</li>
          <li><strong>Non-mesh repairs:</strong> Less seroma formation, lower cost</li>
          <li>Study quality was generally good (low to moderate risk of bias)</li>

      <strong>6. Summarise the evidence for laparoscopic compared to open hernia repairs.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Cochrane Review - Laparoscopic vs Open Techniques for Inguinal Hernia Repair:</strong></p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Repair of a hernia in the groin (inguinal hernia) is the most frequently performed operation in general surgery. The most common laparoscopic technique is <strong>totally extra peritoneal (TEP) repair</strong>. TEP is different as the peritoneal cavity is not entered and mesh is used to seal the hernia from outside the peritoneum.</p>

        <h3>Study Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>41 eligible controlled trials</strong></li>
          <li><strong>7,161 participants</strong> randomized to laparoscopic or open surgery</li>
          <li>Mean/median follow-up: <strong>6-36 months</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p><strong>Advantages of Laparoscopic Repair:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster return to usual activities</strong> - by about 7 days</li>
          <li><strong>Less persisting pain and numbness</strong> than open surgery</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Laparoscopic Repair:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Longer operation times</strong> - approximately 15 minutes longer</li>
          <li><strong>Higher number of serious complications</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Visceral injuries (especially bladder)</li>
              <li>Vascular injuries</li>
              <li>Nerve or major vascular injuries</li>
              <li>Bowel obstruction</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important Note</h3>
        <p><strong>Using a mesh for repair reduced the risk of recurring hernia rather than the method of placement</strong> (open or laparoscopic surgery).</p>

      <strong>8. Briefly describe the following surgical incisions: midline, paramedian, transverse, McBurney, subcostal, Pfannenstiel and kidney transplant incision (donor).</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Midline Incision</h3>
        <p>Vertical incision through the <strong>linea alba</strong> (relatively avascular midline). Can be upper, lower, or extend the full length of abdomen. Most versatile incision with excellent exposure and minimal risk to vessels/nerves.</p>

        <h3>Paramedian Incision</h3>
        <p>Vertical incision <strong>parallel to the midline</strong>, approximately 2-3cm lateral to it. Passes through anterior rectus sheath, retracts rectus muscle laterally, then incises posterior sheath and peritoneum. Less commonly used now.</p>

        <h3>Transverse Incision</h3>
        <p>Horizontal incision across the abdomen. Can be upper (epigastric), middle, or lower (low transverse/suprapubic). Better cosmetic result and less post-op pain than vertical incisions.</p>

        <h3>McBurney Incision</h3>
        <p>Abdominal incision <strong>parallel to the fibres of the external oblique muscle</strong>, about 1/3 of the distance along a line from ASIS to umbilicus, half the incision being above and the remainder below this point. The skin and subcutaneous fat are incised down to the external oblique muscle, the fibres of which are split; the underlying internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles are then split and separated. <strong>Used for appendicectomy.</strong></p>

        <h3>Subcostal Incision (Kocher)</h3>
        <p>Oblique incision <strong>parallel and below the costal margin</strong>, typically on the right (for gallbladder/liver) or left (for spleen). Provides good access to upper abdominal organs.</p>

        <h3>Pfannenstiel Incision</h3>
        <p>A <strong>curved abdominal incision</strong>, the convexity being directed downward just above the symphysis pubis, passing through skin, superficial fascia, and aponeurosis, exposing the pyramidalis and rectus muscles, which are separated from each other in the midline, the peritoneum being opened vertically. <strong>Commonly used for C-sections and pelvic surgery.</strong> Excellent cosmetic result.</p>

        <h3>Kidney Transplant Incision (Donor)</h3>
        <p><strong>Donor nephrectomy:</strong> Typically performed laparoscopically now, but open approach uses a <strong>flank incision</strong> (lateral position with kidney rest elevated). May be subcostal or through the bed of the 11th or 12th rib.</p>

        <p><strong>Recipient kidney transplant:</strong> <strong>Curved lower abdominal incision</strong> in the right or left iliac fossa (extraperitoneal approach). Kidney placed in iliac fossa with anastomoses to iliac vessels.</p>
