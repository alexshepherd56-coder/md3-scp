    <h1>Case 22.2 – Multiple Sclerosis</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Medicine | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Neurology | <strong>Setting:</strong> Neurology Outpatient Clinic</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Ellen Tweedle is a 34 year old woman who you first meet in the neurology outpatient clinic. She has presented with an episode of visual loss which has gradually recovered. This had occurred out of the blue, without any preceding headaches or other symptoms that she could think of. The visual loss had occurred in the right eye only and initially she had not been able to see anything through that eye. The visual loss had been extremely frightening but over a few days had spontaneously recovered. When you examine her you find weakness in the right hand with brisk reflexes down the right arm. This appears to be pyramidal (i.e. the finger and wrist extensors are much weaker than the flexors). Ellen tells you that she had put the weakness down to a lot of work as an osteopath. On visual field testing she has a central scotoma (loss of vision) through the right eye, which she seems to have accommodated to. When examined for her eyes' response to light, her right pupil constricts less when a direct light is shone in that eye than when the light is shone in her left eye. This is called a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). As part of the thorough neurological examination, you pick up decreased sensation to pin prick over the left side of her body, extending from her jaw down her left arm, trunk and leg, stopping at the midline.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. What is the most likely diagnosis? Discuss your rationale including the application of the revised McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. What neurological levels might be affected in order to explain Ellen's neurological signs?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Most Likely Diagnosis:</strong> Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</p>

        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ellen is a young woman (34 years old) - MS typically presents between ages 20-40 and is more common in women (F:M ratio ~3:1)</li>
          <li>She has clinical evidence of lesions affecting multiple parts of the CNS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Optic nerve:</strong> Episode of visual loss with RAPD and central scotoma (consistent with optic neuritis)</li>
            <li><strong>Right corticospinal tract:</strong> Right hand weakness with brisk reflexes (pyramidal pattern)</li>
            <li><strong>Left spinothalamic pathway:</strong> Left-sided pin prick loss from jaw to leg</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Dissemination in space: multiple CNS lesions</li>
          <li>Dissemination in time: the visual loss occurred and recovered; the hand weakness appears to be from an earlier episode; these suggest attacks separated in time</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>McDonald Criteria (2017 Revision) for MS Diagnosis:</strong></p>
        <p>The McDonald criteria require evidence of dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT) of CNS lesions:</p>

        <p><strong>Dissemination in Space (DIS)</strong> requires ≥1 T2 lesion in at least 2 of 4 CNS areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Periventricular</li>
          <li>Cortical or juxtacortical</li>
          <li>Infratentorial</li>
          <li>Spinal cord</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Dissemination in Time (DIT)</strong> can be demonstrated by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions at any time, OR</li>
          <li>A new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI compared with baseline, OR</li>
          <li>Clinical: a second clinical attack involving a different CNS site</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Application to Ellen:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>She has clinical evidence of lesions in multiple areas (optic nerve, corticospinal tract, spinothalamic pathway)</li>
          <li>Her presentation suggests at least two separate episodes (visual loss that recovered, plus existing weakness)</li>
          <li>MRI will be essential to confirm DIS and potentially DIT</li>
          <li>CSF analysis may show oligoclonal bands (present in ~95% of MS patients)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Neurological Levels Affected:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Right optic nerve:</strong> Optic neuritis causing unilateral visual loss, RAPD, and central scotoma</li>
          <li><strong>Right corticospinal tract:</strong> Likely cervical cord or brainstem lesion causing right arm pyramidal weakness</li>
          <li><strong>Left spinothalamic pathway:</strong> Likely right-sided brainstem or cervical cord lesion affecting sensory pathways (spinothalamic tract crosses at the level of entry, so left body sensation is affected by right-sided lesion)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What investigations would help confirm the diagnosis?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Essential Investigations:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1. MRI Brain and Spinal Cord (with and without gadolinium contrast):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most important investigation for MS diagnosis</li>
          <li>Look for T2 hyperintense lesions (bright on T2/FLAIR sequences)</li>
          <li>Typical MS lesions are:
            <ul>
              <li>Periventricular (Dawson's fingers - perpendicular to ventricles)</li>
              <li>Juxtacortical or cortical</li>
              <li>Infratentorial (brainstem, cerebellum)</li>
              <li>Spinal cord (typically partial lesions extending over 1-2 vertebral segments)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Gadolinium enhancement indicates acute/active inflammation (breakdown of blood-brain barrier)</li>
          <li>Helps establish dissemination in space and time per McDonald criteria</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. Lumbar Puncture and CSF Analysis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Oligoclonal bands (OCBs):</strong> Present in CSF but not serum in ~95% of MS patients</li>
          <li><strong>Elevated IgG index:</strong> Indicates intrathecal IgG synthesis</li>
          <li><strong>Cell count:</strong> Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (usually &lt;50 cells/mm³); higher counts suggest alternative diagnosis</li>
          <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Normal or mildly elevated</li>
          <li>CSF analysis helps exclude MS mimics (infection, malignancy, inflammatory conditions)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assess optic nerve function</li>
          <li>Delayed P100 latency indicates optic nerve demyelination (even if subclinical)</li>
          <li>Useful if clinical history suggests optic neuritis</li>
          <li>Can demonstrate subclinical lesions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Blood Tests (to exclude MS mimics):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full blood count, ESR, CRP</li>
          <li>Vitamin B12 and folate (deficiency can mimic MS)</li>
          <li>Thyroid function tests</li>
          <li>ANA, anti-dsDNA, ANCA (to exclude SLE, vasculitis)</li>
          <li>Anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies (to exclude neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder - NMOSD)</li>
          <li>Anti-MOG antibodies (MOG-antibody disease can mimic MS)</li>
          <li>ACE level (sarcoidosis)</li>
          <li>Syphilis and HIV serology (in appropriate clinical context)</li>
          <li>Lyme serology (if relevant exposure history)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Other Tests to Consider:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):</strong> Can detect retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in optic neuritis</li>
          <li><strong>Somatosensory Evoked Potentials:</strong> May show delayed conduction in sensory pathways</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. What are the clinical phenotypes (presentations) of MS?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>There are four main clinical phenotypes of MS:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) - ~85% at onset:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most common initial presentation</li>
          <li>Characterized by clearly defined relapses (acute attacks) with full or partial recovery</li>
          <li>Relapses are followed by periods of remission with no disease progression</li>
          <li>Neurological disability may accumulate with incomplete recovery from relapses</li>
          <li>Between relapses, there is no progression of disability</li>
          <li>Average relapse rate: ~1 per year (but highly variable)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develops in ~50-80% of people with RRMS over 10-20 years</li>
          <li>Initial relapsing-remitting course is followed by gradual neurological deterioration</li>
          <li>Progression occurs with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, or plateaus</li>
          <li>Characterized by steady worsening of disability independent of relapses</li>
          <li>Transition from RRMS to SPMS can be difficult to identify in real-time</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) - ~10-15% at onset:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disease progression from onset without relapses or remissions</li>
          <li>Steady worsening of neurological function from the beginning</li>
          <li>Occasional plateaus or temporary minor improvements may occur</li>
          <li>Tends to present later (mean age ~40 years, compared to ~30 for RRMS)</li>
          <li>Equal gender ratio (unlike RRMS which is more common in women)</li>
          <li>Often presents with progressive myelopathy (spinal cord involvement)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Progressive-Relapsing MS (PRMS) - Rare (~5%):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Progressive disease from onset with clear acute relapses superimposed</li>
          <li>May or may not have recovery from relapses</li>
          <li>Continues to progress between relapses</li>
          <li>Some classification systems have merged this with PPMS</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clinical Features to Define a Relapse:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>New or worsening neurological symptoms lasting >24 hours</li>
          <li>Occurs in the absence of fever or infection</li>
          <li>Separated from previous relapse by at least 30 days</li>
        </ul>

      <strong>5. Describe the management of MS including acute attack management, disease modifying therapies, and symptomatic management</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>1. ACUTE RELAPSE MANAGEMENT:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>High-dose corticosteroids:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Methylprednisolone 1g IV daily for 3-5 days</strong> (or oral prednisolone 500mg daily)</li>
          <li>Shortens duration and severity of acute relapses</li>
          <li>Does NOT affect long-term disability or relapse rate</li>
          <li>Usually well tolerated; side effects include insomnia, mood changes, hyperglycemia, GI upset</li>
          <li>Consider gastric protection (PPI) if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reserved for severe relapses not responding to steroids</li>
          <li>Evidence of benefit in fulminant demyelinating attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES (DMTs):</strong></p>
        <p>Goal: reduce relapse rate, slow disability accumulation, reduce MRI lesion activity</p>

              <li><strong>Dimethyl fumarate:</strong> Twice daily; reduce relapse rate ~40-50%; side effects include flushing, GI upset; monitor lymphocyte count</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Second-line/Higher efficacy DMTs (More effective but higher risk):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fingolimod (oral):</strong> First-dose monitoring required (bradycardia risk); macular edema, infections; very effective</li>
          <li><strong>Natalizumab (IV infusion monthly):</strong> Very effective (~68% relapse reduction); risk of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) especially if JC virus positive; requires monitoring</li>
          <li><strong>Ocrelizumab (IV infusion every 6 months):</strong> Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody; very effective; approved for RRMS and PPMS; infusion reactions, infections</li>
