    <h1>Case 20.4 – Asthma (Acute Exacerbation)</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Children & Young People / Respiratory & ENT Systems | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Paediatrics Medicine | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Adrian Neasby, is a 12 year old asthmatic who is well known to you, he presents with cough and wheeze. Adrian has had an upper respiratory tract infection for a few days. Today while playing soccer he found it hard to get his breath and he couldn't finish the game.</p>
    <p>He regularly uses Flixotide [fluticasone] inhaler 200ug per day. Normally his asthma is well controlled.</p>
    <p>Observation: no acute respiratory distress.<br>
    PEFR = 230 l/min [normal best is 340 l/min]<br>
    Height 149 cm</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Describe the key clinical, physiological, pathological and immunological features of asthma.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>CLINICAL:</strong> asthma is recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough and breathlessness. This is an oversimplification, because it is possible to have asthma without the triad of wheeze, cough and breathlessness. Furthermore, a minority of children with these symptoms will have other conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>PHYSIOLOGICAL:</strong> asthma is a condition associated with airway hyper reactivity and with reversible airways obstruction.</p>

        <p>Objective measurement of airway hyper responsiveness can be obtained by measuring lung function such as peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) in a bronchial challenge test. Airway hyper reactivity is defined as a significant fall (usually about 15-20%) in lung function after inhalation of chemicals (such as methacholine, histamine or mannitol), after inhalation of hypertonic saline, after cold, dry air or following exercise.</p>

        <p>Airway hyper reactivity and reversible (or variable) airways obstruction also may be demonstrated by an increase in PEF or FEV₁ of more than 10% following a bronchodilator, or by fluctuations in PEF measurements obtained on a regular basis at home.</p>

        <p>There are limitations to this physiological definition of asthma. These include the fact that most children are unable to cooperate with challenge tests to measure airway hyper responsiveness (AHR) until they are 5 or 6 years old, and that there is an imperfect correlation between children with AHR and clinical features of asthma.</p>

        <p><strong>PATHOLOGICAL:</strong> asthma relates to mucosal oedema, mucous hypersecretion and smooth muscle spasm in the small airways. Airway inflammation is prominent.</p>

        <p><strong>IMMUNOLOGICAL:</strong> asthma is on the atopic state. In an allergic response, degranulation of mast cells occurs, with the release of chemical mediators into the airways and a resultant asthmatic response. Our understanding of the cytokines that are important in asthma remains incomplete. Indeed, the mast cell, the eosinophil and the neutrophil all seem to have important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What key questions would you ask to assess how well controlled Adrian's asthma is?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The diagnosis of asthma (and ongoing symptoms in uncontrolled asthma) can be made make in the child who has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>recurrent episodes of wheeze</li>
          <li>breathlessness</li>
          <li>cough</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And who is</p>
        <ul>
          <li>completely well between attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other clinical presentations may be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>nocturnal cough</li>
          <li>persistent cough in association with acute respiratory infections</li>
          <li>a history of 'rattly breathing' in the absence of a definite history of wheeze.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. What clinical parameters [history, examination and investigations] would you assess in order to classify the severity of Adrian's asthma? Present these parameters in a table indicating the features of mild, moderate & severe asthma.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Assessment of the severity of an attack:</h3>
        <p>The severity of acute asthma can be classified as mild, moderate, severe or critical. The most reliable indicators are mental state and work of breathing (comprising accessory muscle use and recession).</p>
        <p>Patients with an acute exacerbation of asthma requiring salbutamol every 3 h at home should be assessed by their Local Medical Officer or in the emergency department.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The initial arterial O₂ saturation (SaO2) in air, heart rate and ability to talk should be used as additional features in assessing the severity of acute asthma.</li>
          <li>Wheeze intensity, central cyanosis, pulsus paradoxus, peak expiratory flow are not reliable or the assessment of the severity of acute asthma.</li>
          <li>Arterial blood gases, CXR and spirometry should not be routinely used in assessing the severity of acute asthma.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Adrian's mother mentions that Adrian recently had spirometry performed that showed he had asthma. What are the diagnostic features of asthma on spirometry?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Spirometry to measure FEV₁ and forced vital capacity before and after a bronchodilator may help assess severity and response to therapy. Between exacerbations, children with intermittent disease will have normal lung function and no further improvement after bronchodilators. Children with persistent symptoms may show airways obstruction with improvement after inhalation of a bronchodilator. Fixed airways obstruction suggests either severe asthma or an alternative diagnosis such as cystic fibrosis.</p>
