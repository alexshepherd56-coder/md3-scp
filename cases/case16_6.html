    <h1>Case 16.6 – Teething [SDL]</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Children & Young People | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Paediatrics Medicine | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice | <strong>Topic:</strong> Infant feeding, nutrition and dentition</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Previously well 7 month old Henry Walzak presents with his mother Josephine. She is concerned that Henry has become fussy taking the breast. He seems irritable and not sleeping well. She is not sure whether she should increase his solids or change him to formula.</p>

    <p>She informs you that one of the mothers at her playgroup said that Henry is probably teething and that she should try teething rusks, but she has heard that these can cause cavities in developing teeth. She asks you what you think she should do.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Outline the key features of history and examination of Henry to determine his nutritional status.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Ask what the child usually eats in a typical day, in all settings that the child is in - i.e. home, child care, outings. Children derive up to 30% of their energy from snacks, so it is important to include these in the assessment of all food and fluids consumed.</p>

        <p>Qualitative methods include a dietary history and food frequency questionnaire. These do not allow for the precise calculation of energy or nutrient intakes but rather determine the pattern, style and types of foods eaten.</p>

        <p>Quantitative methods calculate precise energy and nutrient intakes and include a 24-hour food record and a 3-day food record.</p>

        <p>If the initial dietary assessment raises concerns, then referral should be made to a dietitian.</p>

        <h3>Physical examination</h3>
        <p>Physical examination gives a general impression of nutritional status, including signs of anaemia, jaundice, wasting, oedema, lethargy, muscle weakness and fat stores.</p>

        <p>Examination may reveal evidence of specific micronutrient deficiency, including pallor, bruising or bleeding, skin, hair and gum abnormalities, and neurological or ophthalmological disorders. In adolescents, the stage of puberty should be documented.</p>

        <p>Anthropometry refers to the measurement of physical dimensions and body composition. Measurement of height/length and weight gives the most useful assessment of overall nutritional status, although normal growth can still occur in marginally malnourished children. Serial measurements of growth add valuable information about the impact and chronicity of nutritional compromise. The following routine measurements are used for the anthropometric component of a nutritional assessment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>recumbent length before 2 years of age, or height after 2 years of age</li>
          <li>weight for age</li>
          <li>weight for length/height</li>
          <li>head circumference (used until 36 months of age)</li>
          <li>growth velocity</li>
          <li>skinfold thickness (triceps and other sites as indicated)</li>
          <li>midarm circumference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Growth charts for height or length, weight and head circumference are used to monitor growth at different chronological ages. Specific ethnocultural- and even syndrome (Down, Turner)-specific growth charts exist.</p>

        <p>Patients requiring long-term monitoring of nutritional status should have serial measurements of mid arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness to assess fat and muscle stores.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Encourage and support exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age</li>
          <li>Children and adolescents need sufficient nutrition foods to grow and develop normally</li>
          <li>Growth should be checked regularly for young children</li>
          <li>Physical activity is important for all children and adolescents; 3 hours of accumulated physical activity per day for 3-5 year olds, 1 hr of moderate to vigorous activity per day from 5 to 18 years</li>
          <li>Enjoy a wide range of nutritious foods</li>
          <li>Limit intake of food and drinks containing salt</li>
          <li>Children and adolescents should be encouraged to:
            <ul>
              <li>Eat plenty of cereals (including breads, rice, pasta and noodles), preferably wholegrain</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Include lean meat, fish and poultry and/or alternatives</li>
          <li>Include reduced fat milks, yoghurts, cheese and/or alternatives for children over 2 years</li>
          <li>Reduced fat milks are not suitable for young children under 2 years, because of the high energy needs of young children, Milk and water are the recommended drinks for children</li>
          <li>Caffeine-containing energy drinks are not suitable for children Alcohol is not recommended for children</li>
          <li>And care should be taken to:
            <ul>
              <li>Limit intake of energy dense food.</li>
              <li>Limit intake of sugar sweetened drinks and foods.</li>
              <li>Care for your child's food: prepare and store it safely.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Restrictive diets should be avoided unless prescribed by a dietitian</li>
          <li>Adolescents may be vulnerable to disordered eating</li>

        <h3>Teething</h3>
        <p>Teething is a normal process by which an infant begins to cut their first teeth (primary dentition). A variety of symptoms can accompany teething, including sensitive and painful gums, mouth ulceration, drooling, feeding difficulties, lack of sleep, fevers, diarrhoea and crying. The scientific evidence that any of these symptoms are directly related to tooth eruption is controversial. Nevertheless, they are commonly reported and can cause significant distress to the child and anxious parent.</p>

        <p>Similarly there is no evidence base to support any particular management strategy. <strong>The use of chilled teething rings, hard, sugar-free rusk biscuits and finger pressure appears to help.</strong> Over-the-counter teething preparations are of limited use. Not only do many contain choline salicylate and significant amounts of ethanol and are contra-indicated in very young infants but also repeated use can cause ulceration of the gums. Some lidocaine (lignocaine)-based gels are thought to be slightly more effective and may be mildly antiseptic.</p>

        <p>Mild elevations in temperature can be managed with systemic oral medication but temperatures of 38°C and higher or other serious symptoms (e.g. convulsions) should not be ascribed to teething and should be assessed independently.</p>

        <h3>Additional Notes on Dental Caries</h3>
        <p>Dental caries (or decay) is an infectious disease caused by the presence of certain bacteria (predominantly mutans streptococci) in the oral cavity. The mutans streptococci (MS) metabolize sugars and starches to produced acids, which lower the pH of the oral cavity and promote loss of minerals from the tooth surface. Minerals in the oral cavity, including fluoride, are redeposited on the tooth surface once the neutral pH is restored (normally after about 20 minutes). This process is dynamic and as long as minerals are replaced the tooth surface remains sound and intact. If, however, the drop in pH is prolonged and/or frequent there will be a net loss of minerals, leading to a weakening and eventual breakdown (cavitation) of the tooth surface.</p>

        <p>The early sign of mineral loss is characterized by precavitated or 'white spot' lesions, usually around the necks of the teeth where the MS tend to accumulate in a biofilm (known as dental plaque) on the teeth. Early identification of these precavitated lesions is important as they signal the need for proactive preventive measures to encourage remineralization. Failure to change the oral environment to one that encourages remineralization will result in cavities. If this occurs, then restorations (fillings) are necessary.</p>

        <p><strong>Early childhood caries (ECC)</strong>; historically also referred to as nursing bottle caries, baby bottle decay) is a distinct form of dental caries affecting pre-school-age children. ECC is particularly virulent, causing massive destruction to the primary dentition in children as young as 18 months of age. At birth MS do not inhabit the oral cavity; however, the earlier colonization occurs the greater the risk of ECC. The most common source for transmission of MS has been shown to be the primary care giver, usually the mother.</p>

        <p><strong>Fluoride</strong> is the single most effective way to protect teeth from decay. It acts in two ways; it can enhance the ability of teeth to resist demineralization caused by intraoral acids and it can also inhibit oral bacterial enzymes to reduce the conversion of sugars in to acids. However, the latter effect is relatively small in comparison to its biochemical modification of the structure of tooth enamel.</p>
