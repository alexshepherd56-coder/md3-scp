    <h1>Case 11.2 – Umbilical Hernias</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Surgery | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Surgery - General | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Ron Camper, aged 21 years presents complaining of a painful 2cm nodule in the periumbilical region. He advises that he has had a nodule that has "come and gone" since birth but it has never been painful. He now feels nauseous.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Outline your assessment and management of Ron.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Assessment Priorities:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Need to determine if this is an <strong>urgent situation</strong> - is there evidence of <strong>strangulation</strong>? Is the hernia <strong>reducible</strong>?</li>
          <li>Is the nausea related to the lump, or is there another cause?</li>
          <li><strong>Examination of the lump</strong> - location, size, reducibility, tenderness, cough impulse</li>
          <li>Investigation of this patient will be determined by the urgency of the situation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key Concern:</strong> Given Ron's nausea and new-onset pain in a previously asymptomatic hernia, there is concern for <strong>incarceration or strangulation</strong> which would require urgent surgical intervention.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What are the 3 common types of umbilical hernia and what is the pathophysiology of each type?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>1. Congenital (Infantile) Umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p>
        <p>This condition is caused by a <strong>widening of the natural defect in the linea alba at birth</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The complex folding of the developing embryo results in the formation of the coelomic cavity</li>
          <li>The apices of the folds form the <strong>umbilical ring</strong> through which the midgut communicates with the yolk sac and the connecting stalk (containing umbilical vein and arteries) passes to the placenta</li>
          <li>The developing gut grows more rapidly than the coelomic capacity and so <strong>prolapses into the wide base of the umbilical cord</strong> - the extra-embryonic coelom - as a temporary hernia</li>
          <li>The abdominal cavity subsequently enlarges, and by the <strong>12th week</strong> the herniated intestinal loops return, undergoing rotation as they do so</li>
          <li>After the return of the gut, the umbilical ring constricts, but a defect persists until birth for passage of umbilical vessels</li>
          <li>After delivery, the umbilical vessels thrombose, and fibrous tissue forms and condenses to plug the defect</li>
          <li>A <strong>congenital umbilical hernia results if this sequence is incomplete</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. True Umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protrusion <strong>through the umbilical scar</strong>, everting the umbilicus, whose attenuated fibres are at the apex of the hernial sac</li>
          <li>The cause is often secondary to an <strong>increase in the volume of contents of the abdominal cavity</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Obesity</li>
              <li>Ascites</li>
              <li>Large benign or malignant intra-abdominal tumours</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Para-umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>weakest area of the umbilical scar is at the superior aspect</strong> between the umbilical vein and the upper margin of the umbilical ring</li>
          <li>It is at this point that a para-umbilical hernia develops</li>
          <li>The emerging sac <strong>displaces the umbilical scar</strong>, which lies below and slightly to one side</li>
          <li>These hernias are <strong>more common than true umbilical hernias</strong> and typically found in obese middle-aged patients</li>
          <li>The <strong>neck of the hernia is often narrow</strong> - in consequence, tissues that enter have great difficulty leaving</li>
          <li>Adhesions form and the hernia becomes <strong>irreducible</strong></li>
          <li>The sac progressively acquires more contents and may become very large</li>
          <li>Contents are usually <strong>omentum</strong>, often with small bowel or transverse colon</li>
          <li>Frequently the sac becomes <strong>loculated</strong> when adhesions form between omentum and peritoneum</li>
          <li><strong>At risk of strangulation</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. How does the common type of umbilical hernia typically present?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Clinical Presentation of Para-umbilical Hernia (most common type):</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local pain and swelling at the navel</strong></li>
          <li>Non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms are common</li>
          <li>Features of recurrent intestinal obstruction may have occurred</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Physical Examination:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>umbilicus assumes a crescent shape</strong></li>
          <li>Inspection and palpation reveal a swelling <strong>just above the umbilicus</strong> whose centre (in contrast to true umbilical hernia) is <strong>not attached to the apex of the protrusion</strong></li>
          <li>In <strong>grossly obese patients</strong>, the swelling may not be obvious to the naked eye and moreover is barely palpable</li>
          <li>In others the hernia may be <strong>enormous</strong></li>
          <li>Usually it is <strong>reducible (at least in part)</strong> and there is a <strong>cough impulse</strong></li>
          <li>If reduction is possible, the palpable defect can be of any size, from <strong>one fingertip to admitting the fist</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. Summarise the treatment of umbilical hernias.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>True Umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any <strong>underlying cause should be sought and dealt with</strong></li>
          <li>In the rare event that nothing is found and the hernia is causing symptoms, it is treated as a para-umbilical hernia</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Para-umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Indications for Surgery:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Symptomatic hernias require treatment</li>
          <li>There is a <strong>high risk of strangulation</strong>, and repair should be advised, <strong>even in the absence of symptoms</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Surgical Technique:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The usual procedure is to:
            <ul>
              <li>Mobilise the sac and its contents</li>
              <li>Return the contents to the abdomen</li>
              <li>Close the neck</li>
              <li>Repair the abdominal wall by overlapping its layers</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In herniae <strong>less than 5mm</strong>: fascial closure</li>
          <li>Others consider: <strong>onlay or sublay mesh, plug mesh, sandwich mesh if recurrent</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strangulated Umbilical Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Diagnostic Trap:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The patient with <strong>severe abdominal pain and vomiting</strong> and a <strong>soft non-tender umbilical hernia</strong> is a diagnostic trap</li>
          <li>The loculated nature of the hernia allows a strangulated portion of bowel to go unnoticed clinically</li>
          <li>In other instances, the local features of strangulation may be obvious</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Operative Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Same as for elective case</li>
          <li>Strangulating contents dealt with according to their state</li>
          <li>Devitalized tissue resected if necessary</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Briefly describe the cutaneous nerve supply of the abdominal wall.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Cutaneous Nerve Supply of the Abdominal Wall:</strong></p>

        <p>The anterior rami of <strong>thoracic spinal nerves T7 to T12</strong> follow the inferior slope of the lateral parts of the ribs and cross the costal margin to enter the abdominal wall.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intercostal nerves T7 to T11</strong> supply skin and muscle of the abdominal wall</li>
          <li><strong>Subcostal nerve T12</strong> also supplies skin and muscle of the abdominal wall</li>
          <li>In addition, <strong>T5 and T6</strong> supply upper parts of the external oblique muscle of the abdominal wall</li>
          <li><strong>T6</strong> also supplies cutaneous innervation to skin over the xiphoid</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Dermatomal Landmarks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>T6 - Xiphoid process level</li>
          <li>T7 - Upper abdomen</li>
          <li>T8 - Mid-abdomen</li>
          <li>T10 - Umbilicus level</li>
          <li>T11 - Lower abdomen</li>
          <li>T12 - Suprapubic region</li>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. Briefly describe the anatomy and pathophysiology of incisional hernias.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
        <p>An <strong>incisional hernia</strong> is one that occurs through the wound of a previous operation. It has the same features as a hernia caused by non-surgical injury to the abdominal wall.</p>
        <p><strong>Partial dehiscence</strong> of all or part of the deeper fascial layers occurs, but the skin remains intact or eventually heals.</p>

        <h3>Preoperative Factors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age</strong> - the tissues of the elderly do not heal as well as those of the young</li>
          <li><strong>Malnutrition</strong> - protein-calorie malnutrition, vitamin deficiency (vitamin C essential for collagen maturation), trace metal deficiency (zinc required for epithelialisation)</li>
          <li><strong>Sepsis</strong> - worsens malnutrition and delays anabolism</li>
          <li><strong>Uraemia</strong> - inhibits fibroblast division</li>
          <li><strong>Jaundice</strong> - impedes collagen maturation</li>
          <li><strong>Obesity</strong> - predisposes to wound infection, seroma and haematoma</li>
          <li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> - predisposes to wound infection</li>
          <li><strong>Steroids</strong> - have a generalised proteolytic effect</li>
          <li><strong>Peritoneal contamination (peritonitis)</strong> - predisposes to wound infection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Operative Factors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Type of incision</strong> - vertical incisions more prone to hernia than transverse ones</li>
          <li><strong>Technique and materials</strong> - tension in closure impedes blood supply to wound; badly tied knots can work loose; closure with rapidly absorbable suture material fails to support abdominal wall for sufficient time</li>
          <li><strong>Type of operation</strong> - operations involving bowel or urinary tract more likely to develop wound infection</li>
          <li><strong>Drains</strong> - a drain passing through the wound often results in a hernia</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Postoperative Factors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wound infection</strong> - equal in importance with wrong choice of suture material: enzymatic destruction of healing tissues; inflammatory swelling raises tissue tension and impedes blood supply; <strong>5-20% of wound infections result in a hernia</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Abdominal distension</strong> - postoperative ileus increases tension on wound; stitches may cut out</li>
          <li><strong>Coughing</strong> - generates wound tension</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pathological Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Most incisional hernias develop <strong>within 1 year</strong> of an operation</li>
          <li>It is unusual for a previously sound closure to become herniated <strong>after 3 years</strong></li>
          <li>Once a hernia has formed, mechanical forces ensure that it <strong>inexorably enlarges</strong></li>
          <li>Incisional hernias are extremely variable - may be wide or narrow-necked</li>
          <li>Often, as contents accumulate, <strong>adhesions develop</strong> in the sac and just deep to the neck, so the hernia becomes both <strong>irreducible and loculated</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Incarceration and strangulation</strong> then become real dangers</li>
          <li>The sac can assume huge proportions, eventually housing much of the normal intraperitoneal contents</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>7. Briefly describe the treatment options of incisional hernias.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Indications for Repair:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Even <strong>small symptomatic hernias should be repaired early</strong></li>
          <li>In asymptomatic hernias the risks of <strong>intestinal obstruction, strangulation and skin ulceration</strong> are such that repair, even in older patients, is also recommended</li>
          <li>Protracted observation simply allows the hernia to increase in size, and subsequent repair is rendered more difficult and hazardous</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Surgical Technique:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The surgical technique is <strong>the same as for para-umbilical hernias</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Mobilise the sac and its contents</li>
              <li>Return contents to abdomen</li>
              <li>Close the neck</li>
              <li>Repair abdominal wall by overlapping its layers</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Larger hernias</strong> may require <strong>prosthetic mesh reconstruction</strong> of the abdominal wall</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>8. Briefly describe the following: Obturator hernia, epigastric hernia and diastasis recti.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Obturator Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Anatomy and Pathophysiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Herniation occurs along the <strong>obturator canal</strong>, which carries the obturator nerve and vessels out of the pelvis</li>
          <li>Most commonly seen in <strong>frail old ladies</strong></li>
          <li>The hernia starts as a pre-peritoneal plug and gradually enlarges, taking a sac of peritoneum with it</li>
          <li>A loop of bowel may enter the sac and reduce spontaneously</li>
          <li>Eventually a knuckle fails to reduce, and further loops can then be incorporated</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Lying deep to the pectineus, these hernias are largely <strong>asymptomatic until complicated by intestinal obstruction or strangulation</strong></li>
          <li>There is often a past history of <strong>intermittent symptoms of obstruction</strong></li>
          <li>In about 50% there may be complaint of <strong>pain along the upper medial side of the thigh</strong> which radiates down to the knee, caused by pressure on the obturator nerve</li>
          <li><strong>Signs:</strong> There are rarely any signs, except those of obstruction or strangulation</li>
          <li>The diagnosis is made in most instances at the time of <strong>laparotomy for small-bowel obstruction of unknown cause</strong></li>
          <li>With pressure on the obturator nerve, the patient holds the <strong>leg flexed</strong> to reduce the pain</li>
          <li>In 20% of patients, the hernial sac protrudes medially around the pectineus and presents as a palpable swelling in the femoral triangle</li>
          <li>Rectal and especially <strong>vaginal examination</strong> can reveal a swelling in the region of the obturator foramen</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Epigastric Hernia</h3>
        <p><strong>Anatomy and Pathophysiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>linea alba</strong> is the raphe formed by the junction of the rectus sheaths and the decussation of their fibres across the midline; extends from xiphoid process to symphysis pubis</li>
          <li>In its upper half, it is 1-3 cm wide and fibrous, but below the umbilicus it is a narrow cord</li>
          <li>The linea may be attenuated because of congenital weakness in its lattice structure</li>
          <li>Small neurovascular bundles that penetrate are also points of diminished resistance</li>
          <li><strong>Herniations of extraperitoneal fat through the linea</strong> usually occur in its upper half</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Three-quarters of epigastric hernias are asymptomatic</strong> and found incidentally on physical examination</li>
          <li>When symptoms are present they are of two types:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Local pain</strong> - often exacerbated by physical exertion</li>
              <li><strong>Ill-defined pain</strong> - epigastric in site, often worse after meals (abdominal distension may strangulate the contents), and the clinical picture may mimic that of peptic ulceration</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The hernia may be visible if the patient is placed in an <strong>oblique light</strong></li>
          <li>The swelling is palpable in the <strong>midline</strong> and is usually <strong>tender and irreducible</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> A patient who presents with vague upper-abdominal symptoms and in whom an epigastric hernia is found should be <strong>fully investigated for the possibility of peptic ulcer, gallbladder or pancreatic disease</strong> before symptoms are attributed to the hernia.</p>

        <h3>Diastasis Recti</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Separation of the rectus abdominis</strong>, may occur anywhere from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus</li>
          <li>Principally occurs in <strong>neonates and during pregnancy</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Treatment options:</strong> observe during pregnancy, physiotherapy, surgery</li>
        </ul>
