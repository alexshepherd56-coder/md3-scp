    <h1>Case 29.2 – Urinary Urge Incontinence</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Endocrine & Reproductive Symptoms | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Obstetrics & Gynaecology | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Suzanne Pawley is aged 35 years, she presents complaining of worsening problems with her bladder. She needs to go to the toilet to pass urine a lot and when she has to go, she has to rush. Lately she has experienced urine leakage on a few occasions, which she has found very embarrassing, especially if she is out and she cannot find a toilet fast enough.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. What are the key features of this history that will support a diagnosis of urinary urge incontinence? What medical conditions and medications may contribute to her symptoms?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Key features of history in relation to urge incontinence - urgency associated with a compelling desire to void (if Suzanne is out she describes not being able to find a toilet fast enough) and typically patient can lose urine on the way to the toilet (Suzanne has experienced urine leakage on a few occasions), associated with a low level of urine loss. Symptoms of urinary tract infection or other bladder pathology (haematuria) should be enquired about. Need to exclude conditions that may contribute such as polydipsia or poorly controlled DM with polyuria. Medications such as diuretics may also contribute.</p>

      <strong>2. What are the key features of physical examination and why?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Urge incontinence associated with detrusor overactivity/over active bladder syndrome.</p>

        <p>It can be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Idiopathic - anxiety, coffee intake, alcohol and cold weather are said to influence symptoms.</li>
          <li>Neurogenic (upper motor neuron lesion, ie multiple sclerosis, spinal trauma and cerebral vascular accidents).</li>
          <li>Bladder irritation after surgery with the presence of a mid-urethral sling or due to complication such as erosion of mesh materials in the bladder.</li>
          <li>Hormonal- hypo oestrogenic states (postmenopausal, post-delivery and breastfeeding)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Physical examination as in case one but particularly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neurological</strong> - sensation sacral dermatomes (S2-S4) - perineal sensation and anal tone. Lower limb neurological examination - assess if needed for other conditions eg multiple sclerosis, parkinsonism.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. Giving consideration to the physiology of micturition what is the abnormality that occurs in urinary urge incontinence.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The main role of the bladder is to store urine and to act as an efficient low pressure, continent, reservoir. Urine from the kidneys enters the bladder via the ureters at a rate of 0.5-5 ml/min. Normally sensation of bladder filling is noted at between 15-250ml and there is a strong desire to void at approximately 400-600 mls.</p>

        <p>To maintain continence urethral pressure must exceed bladder pressure at all times except during micturition. The intravesical pressure must remain low and the urethral lumen should seal completely. With voiding - cortical inhibition is released and there is a relaxation of the pelvic floor together with relaxation of the striated muscles surrounding the urethra. Parasympathetic impulses via pelvic nerve also cause the detrusor to contract. Extrinsic striated muscle of the pelvic floor contracts to stop the flow of urine. The smooth muscle of the detrusor is slower to relax.</p>

        <p>An abnormally high detrusor pressure may occur in detrusor overactivity when there is an inability to inhibit these detrusor contractions.</p>

      <strong>4. What investigations would you undertake and why?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mid-stream specimen of urine:</strong> It is important to exclude UTI as a cause of symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency/volume chart:</strong> may indicate excessive drinking or bad habits as the cause of the symptoms. Self awareness and monitoring may modify the behaviour.</li>
          <li><strong>Another option to confirm the diagnosis is a pad test</strong> (weighing a pad to determine loss after a women drinks 500mls of water and undertakes activities).</li>
          <li><strong>Urodynamics studies</strong> particularly if a patient has failed conservative therapy. It is important to exclude voiding dysfunction as starting anti-cholinergic medication may potentially put patient into retention.</li>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. You explain to Suzanne that you would like to assess her bladder function further by completing a fluid balance diary [frequency volume chart]. Explain what this is and how it is done. What findings would indicate normal bladder function?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>A bladder diary provides an objective measure of patient's symptoms, and allows a comparison over time, and with treatment, as well as making the patient aware of her voiding habits. Time of voiding, volume voided, and whether incontinent or not is recorded. The amount of urinary loss with incontinence is not measured but the patient can make a subjective estimate, such as 'slight leakage' or 'soaked'. It is usually completed over three non-consecutive 24 hour periods.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. Suzanne returns with her fluid balance diary shown here. How would you interpret this diary, what would you explain to Suzanne?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Small frequent voids with leakage associated with urgency during day and at night. Minimal fluid intake with caffeinated beverages.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>7. You advise Suzanne that she may benefit from 'bladder retraining'. Explain a behavioural bladder management programme to Suzanne.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The aim of bladder retraining is to increase the capacity of the bladder until it can hold the normal amount of urine (400-500mls) enabling the patient to void every three to four hours. This requires learning to suppress bladder contractions using a number of techniques including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a bladder diary to keep track of progress</li>
          <li>Maintain fluid intake at 1.5-2L per day</li>
          <li>Easier to start this at home where there is some security</li>
          <li>Avoid going to the toilet just in case.</li>
          <li>When desire to void occurs, allow urge to pass and slowly increase the period of time the patient can defer voiding. Several strategies can be used to defer voiding including pelvic floor contraction, perineal pressure or mental distraction.</li>
          <li>This should be continued for 3 months to realise full benefits.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>8. Suzanne mentions that she has a friend who is using a medication that relaxes the bladder. What medications are available that do this? How do they work? What are the main contra-indications and side effects that need to be monitored?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Anti-cholinergic medications such as oxybutynin (Ditropan), tolteradine (Detrusitrol) and solifenacin (Vesicare) are muscarinic antagonists that decrease parasympathetic stimulus which is responsible for detrusor contraction.</p>

        <p>Specific contraindications include a history for acute narrow-angle closure glaucoma, risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction, urinary tract obstruction or voiding dysfunction, myasthenia gravis.</p>

        <p>The side-effects include dry mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), constipation, heartburn, dry skin, drowsiness (particular an issue in the elderly).</p>

        <p>Mirabegron (Betmiga) is a new drug which is a beta 3 agonist antispasmodic agent. The side effects include nausea, dizziness, constipation, diarrhoea and headache.</p>
