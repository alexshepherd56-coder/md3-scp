    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Harper Jones, aged 6 months, presents with a painful mass in his groin region. Harper has started vomiting and looks unwell.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Outline your management of Harper.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Obtain a complete history and perform a physical examination to establish a diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a <strong>strangulated inguinal hernia</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Immediate Management:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manual reduction:</strong> An immediate attempt should be made to reduce the hernia manually</li>
          <li>This is done by first <strong>disimpacting the hernia at the external inguinal ring</strong>, and then <strong>reducing it along the line of the inguinal canal</strong></li>
          <li>Fortunately, most hernias that become stuck can be reduced manually</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Subsequent Management:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Once reduced, the hernia can then be <strong>repaired as an elective procedure within a few days</strong></li>
          <li>This is best done in a <strong>specialist paediatric surgical centre</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. How do the following conditions present: inguinal hernia, hydrocele, undescended testes and torsion of the testes?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Inguinal Hernia</h3>
        <p>A widely patent proximal processus vaginalis allows bowel (and, in girls, the ovary as well) to enter the inguinal canal, producing a reducible lump in the groin called an indirect inguinal hernia.</p>

        <p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Occurs in about <strong>2% of live male births</strong> but is less frequent in girls</li>
          <li>Greatest incidence is in the <strong>first year of life</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intermittent swelling</strong> overlying the external inguinal ring that has been noticed by a parent</li>
          <li>May appear to cause discomfort at times</li>
          <li>Most likely to be obvious during episodes of <strong>crying or straining</strong></li>
          <li>In infants may be <strong>seen during nappy changes</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inguinal hernias should be <strong>repaired as soon as practicable</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Strangulation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common, particularly during the <strong>first 6 months of life</strong></li>
          <li>Recognized when the groin swelling becomes <strong>irreducible</strong></li>
          <li>Associated with <strong>irritability and crying</strong> (due to pain and abdominal cramps) and <strong>vomiting</strong></li>
          <li>If left untreated, may damage the incarcerated bowel</li>
          <li>Occasionally, by compressing the testicular vessels may lead to <strong>testicular atrophy</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hydrocele</h3>
        <p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Presents as a <strong>painless cystic swelling around the testis</strong> in the scrotum</li>
          <li>Contains peritoneal fluid that has tracked down a narrow but patent processus vaginalis</li>
          <li><strong>Transilluminates brilliantly</strong></li>
          <li>When the hydrocele is lax, the testis can be felt within it</li>
          <li>The <strong>upper limit can be demonstrated distal to the external inguinal ring</strong>, distinguishing it from an inguinal hernia</li>
          <li><strong>No impulse on crying or straining</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Natural History:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common in the first few months of life</li>
          <li>Do not cause discomfort</li>
          <li>Usually <strong>disappear spontaneously</strong></li>
          <li>Surgery only indicated if the hydrocele <strong>persists beyond 2 years of age</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Undescended Testes</h3>
        <p>Undescended testis (or cryptorchidism) is a term used to describe the testis that does not reside spontaneously in the scrotum.</p>

        <p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Occur in about <strong>2% of boys</strong></li>
          <li>More common in premature infants</li>
          <li>Spontaneous descent of the testis is <strong>unlikely beyond 3 months post-term</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Will result in <strong>reduced fertility</strong> if left untreated</li>
          <li>Suspected that the higher temperature to which an undescended testis is subject impairs spermatogenesis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Made by examining the inguinoscrotal region</li>
          <li>Normally, the testis should be found within the scrotal sac</li>
          <li>In cryptorchidism the <strong>scrotum looks empty</strong></li>
          <li>The testis is 'milked' down the line of the inguinal canal towards the scrotum</li>
          <li>If the testis <strong>cannot be brought into the scrotum or will not remain there spontaneously</strong> it is considered undescended</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Retractile Testis vs Undescended Testis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>May be difficult to distinguish clinically</li>
          <li>In most normal boys the testis resides in the bottom of the scrotum</li>
          <li>The <strong>cremasteric reflex</strong> (prominent during mid-childhood) may cause it to move upwards</li>
          <li><strong>Retractile testis:</strong> Can be brought down into the normal position and should <strong>stay there spontaneously</strong>, at least until the cremasteric reflex is stimulated</li>
          <li><strong>Undescended testis:</strong> Will not stay in the scrotum spontaneously and usually cannot even be coerced beyond the neck of the scrotum</li>
          <li>Often <strong>smaller than a normal testis</strong> on the other side</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Torsion of the Testes</h3>
        <p>There are a number of conditions that cause an acutely painful or enlarged scrotum of which <strong>torsion of a testicular appendage</strong> is the most common, and <strong>torsion of the testis itself</strong> the most important.</p>

        <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The boy complains of <strong>severe pain in the scrotum</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Torsion of Testicular Appendage (Early Stages):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>blue-black 'pea-sized' swelling</strong> which is extremely tender to touch may be seen through the skin of the scrotum near the upper pole of the testis</li>
          <li>Palpation of the testis itself causes no discomfort</li>
          <li>Later, a reactive hydrocele develops, the tenderness becomes more generalized</li>
          <li>Clinical features may make it difficult to distinguish from torsion of the testis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Torsion of the Testis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both the <strong>testis and the epididymis are exquisitely tender</strong> (unless necrosis has already occurred)</li>
          <li>The testis may be <strong>lying high within the scrotum</strong></li>
          <li>In older boys the pain <strong>radiates to the ipsilateral iliac fossa</strong></li>
          <li>May be associated with <strong>nausea and vomiting</strong></li>
          <li>Produces symptoms similar to those of appendicitis</li>
          <li><strong>Important:</strong> Always examine the scrotum in boys presenting with lower abdominal pain</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. In point form, differentiate between the following conditions: smegma, balanitis, phimosis, paraphimosis and hypospadias.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Smegma</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Smegma accumulates beneath the adherent foreskin</li>
          <li>Smegma is <strong>normal</strong>, and is released spontaneously as the foreskin separates from the glans penis</li>
          <li>When released, may be associated with some redness and irritation of the foreskin for a day or so: this, too, is a normal process</li>
          <li>Appears as <strong>asymmetrical accumulations of yellow-tinged material</strong> predominantly in the coronal groove beneath the foreskin</li>
          <li>May produce a noticeable swelling, which may be misdiagnosed as a dermoid cyst or tumour</li>
          <li>Often misinterpreted as being mid-shaft because a small child's coronal groove may be a long way from the tip of the foreskin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balanitis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Infection can develop beneath the foreskin</li>
          <li>If severe, <strong>pus may appear from the end of the foreskin</strong></li>
          <li>Often associated with phimosis</li>
          <li>Infection may cause considerable <strong>redness and swelling of the penile shaft</strong></li>
          <li>Requires treatment with either <strong>topical or oral antibiotics</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phimosis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The opening at the tip of the foreskin has <strong>narrowed down to such a degree that the foreskin cannot be retracted</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>external urethral meatus is not visible</strong></li>
          <li>Must be distinguished from the normal adherence of the foreskin to the glans</li>
          <li>In most boys, phimosis can be treated by <strong>application of steroid ointment</strong> (e.g. betamethasone valerate ointment) to the tight, shiny part of the foreskin</li>
          <li>This usually obviates the need for circumcision</li>
          <li>However, marked previous inflammation, infection, skin splitting and balanitis xerotica obliterans can lead to marked scarring - in many of these children the only reasonable treatment is circumcision</li>
          <li>Sometimes the severity of phimosis is such that there is <strong>ballooning of the foreskin on micturition</strong></li>
          <li>On rare occasions it may even cause <strong>urinary retention with a distended bladder</strong></li>
          <li>A degree of phimosis is <strong>common in infancy</strong> but tends to resolve spontaneously in the first few years of life, and is not considered abnormal in this age group</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paraphimosis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Occurs when a mildly phimotic foreskin has been <strong>retracted over the glans and has become stuck behind the coronal groove</strong></li>
          <li>Causes <strong>oedema of itself and the glans penis</strong></li>
          <li>It is a <strong>painful and progressive process</strong></li>
          <li>Treatment involves <strong>gentle manipulation of the foreskin forwards</strong>, which may require a general anaesthetic</li>
          <li>Circumcision is not performed at this time</li>
          <li>A few children may need circumcision subsequently if the phimosis does not respond to topical application of steroid ointment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hypospadias</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>foreskin looks square and hangs off the penis</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>shaft of the penis is bent ventrally</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The two main problems in hypospadias are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Location of the urethra:</strong> Can be found on the ventral side of the shaft of the penis, proximal to its correct position</li>
          <li><strong>Chordee:</strong> Ventral angulation of the shaft and glans. Correction of chordee to straighten the penis is required to allow later successful sexual function</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Circumcision is absolutely contraindicated</strong> in hypospadias because the skin of the prepuce is used during repair of the hypospadias</li>
          <li>Severe hypospadias may be indicative of an <strong>intersex abnormality</strong></li>
          <li>When there is penoscrotal hypospadias and a bifid scrotum, the scrotum should be examined carefully for testes</li>
          <li>Some of these children may be females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; the labioscrotal folds are labia rather than scrota, and the presumed urethral opening may in fact be the entrance to the vagina</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. What are the key arguments for and against routine circumcision?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The indications for circumcision remain controversial.</p>

        <h3>Arguments For Circumcision</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Circumcision <strong>lowers the risk of urinary tract infection</strong> in the first year of life (1 in 500 in circumcised vs 1 in 100 in uncircumcised)</li>
          <li>Although a rare condition (1/100,000), the <strong>risk of cancer of the penis is reduced 10 fold</strong> in circumcised males</li>
          <li>Studies are conflicting, but some report that circumcised males have a <strong>slightly lower risk of getting sexually transmitted infections</strong>. Only in Sub-Saharan Africa is the risk of HIV higher in uncircumcised males</li>
          <li>Circumcision <strong>eliminates risk of balanitis</strong></li>
          <li>Circumcision <strong>eliminates the risk of phimosis</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Genital hygiene</strong>, which is particularly important in unsanitary conditions, may be easier after circumcision</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arguments Against Circumcision</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The overall <strong>complication rate varies from 0.2-10%</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Local infection and bleeding</strong> are the most common complications</li>
          <li>Infection is usually minor, but <strong>septicaemia and meningitis</strong> have been rarely described</li>
          <li><strong>Damage to the meatus of the urethra</strong> leading to a meatal stricture</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary phimosis and secondary chordee</strong></li>
          <li>Problems with healing of the circumcision wound</li>
          <li>Almost all uncircumcised boys can be taught <strong>proper hygiene</strong> that can lower their chances of getting infections, cancer of the penis, and sexually transmitted diseases</li>
          <li><strong>Loss of penis (1/1,000,000)</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>7. What is torticollis and how do the causes differ in younger compared to older children?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Torticollis</strong>, or wry neck, is a condition in which the <strong>head is tilted to one side and the chin is elevated and turned towards the other side</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Causation in Younger Children</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Postural torticollis:</strong> A benign condition that presents at birth and usually resolves in a few months and is due to intrauterine position</li>
          <li><strong>Sternomastoid tumour:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Not present at birth</li>
              <li>Presents in the <strong>third week of life</strong> with a hard lump in the neck, or that the head cannot be turned to one side</li>
              <li>The head is flexed slightly to the side of the shortened sternomastoid muscle, and is turned to the contralateral side</li>
              <li>May be a history of <strong>breech or forceps delivery</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Other conditions occurring at a younger age include:
            <ul>
              <li>Cervical hemivertebrae</li>
              <li>Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Causation in Older Children</h3>
        <p>Causation in older children is generally due to <strong>acquired conditions or previously undetected congenital conditions</strong>. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Imbalance of ocular muscles</strong> due to strabismus</li>
          <li><strong>Posterior fossa tumours</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Atlanto-occipital/axial subluxation</strong> following injury</li>
          <li><strong>Sandifer's syndrome:</strong> Abnormal head tilt secondary to gastro-oesophageal reflux</li>
          <li><strong>Lateral cervical lymphadenitis</strong></li>
        </ul>
