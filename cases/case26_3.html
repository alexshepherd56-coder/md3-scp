    <h1>Case 26.3 – Polymyalgia Rheumatica & Temporal Arteritis</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Medicine | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Rheumatology | <strong>Setting:</strong> Emergency Department</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Mrs. Margaret Thompson, a 72-year-old retired teacher, is brought to the Emergency Department by her daughter with a 2-day history of severe headache, jaw pain while eating, and sudden onset of visual disturbance in her right eye this morning. She describes the vision in her right eye as "like a curtain coming down." Over the past 6 weeks, she has been experiencing bilateral shoulder and hip pain with marked morning stiffness lasting over 2 hours. She has felt generally unwell with fatigue, low-grade fevers, and unintentional weight loss of 4 kg. She has had difficulty lifting her arms to brush her hair and getting out of chairs. Her daughter notes she has been complaining of headaches for the past 3 weeks, particularly over her temples, and scalp tenderness when combing her hair.</p>

    <p><strong>Past Medical History:</strong> Hypertension, osteoarthritis<br>
    <strong>Medications:</strong> Amlodipine 5mg OD, paracetamol PRN<br>
    <strong>Social History:</strong> Non-smoker, occasional alcohol<br>
    <strong>Family History:</strong> Mother had "rheumatism"</p>

    <div class="vital-signs">Vital signs: BP 168/92 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 16/min, Temp 37.6°C, SpO₂ 97% on room air. Examination: Appears unwell, temporal artery prominence and tenderness on right side, reduced visual acuity right eye (6/36), relative afferent pupillary defect right eye, pale optic disc right eye on fundoscopy. Musculoskeletal: shoulder and hip girdle tenderness bilaterally, painful restriction of shoulder abduction and internal rotation, normal distal joint examination, no muscle weakness on formal testing</div>

        <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
        <strong>Question 1:</strong> What is the most likely diagnosis, and what is the medical emergency in this case? What immediate investigation and management should be initiated?
      </button>
      <div id="q1" class="answer">
        <p><strong>Most likely diagnosis:</strong> Giant cell arteritis (GCA, also known as temporal arteritis) with visual loss, in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).</p>

        <p><strong>Medical emergency:</strong> This is a rheumatological emergency due to visual loss from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Without immediate treatment, there is high risk of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Permanent bilateral blindness (the contralateral eye is at very high risk within days)</li>
          <li>Other vascular complications (stroke, aortic dissection)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Immediate investigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Urgent blood tests:</strong> ESR and CRP (typically markedly elevated - ESR often >50 mm/hr, frequently >100 mm/hr), FBC (may show normochromic normocytic anaemia, thrombocytosis), U&Es, LFTs (alkaline phosphatase may be elevated)</li>
          <li><strong>Do NOT delay treatment waiting for results</strong> - if clinical suspicion is high, treat immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Temporal artery biopsy:</strong> Should be arranged urgently (ideally within 7 days of starting steroids, but can still be diagnostic up to 2 weeks) - but do NOT delay treatment to arrange biopsy</li>
          <li><strong>Urgent ophthalmology review</strong> for full assessment of visual loss</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Immediate management:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 500mg-1g daily for 3 days</strong> (for patients with visual symptoms), OR</li>
          <li><strong>High-dose oral prednisolone 40-60mg daily immediately</strong> (if no visual symptoms, or if IV not available but start oral immediately)</li>
          <li><strong>Do NOT wait for biopsy or test results</strong> - treatment should be started on clinical suspicion alone</li>
          <li>Aspirin 75mg daily (antiplatelet effect may reduce risk of further ischemic events)</li>
          <li>Gastroprotection (PPI)</li>
          <li>Bone protection (calcium/vitamin D, consider bisphosphonate)</li>
          <li>Arrange temporal artery biopsy urgently but do not delay steroid treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key point:</strong> GCA with visual symptoms is a "treat first, investigate later" emergency. Visual loss may be irreversible, but immediate high-dose steroids can prevent bilateral blindness.</p>

        <strong>Question 2:</strong> Describe the relationship between polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA). What are the typical clinical features of each condition?
      </button>
      <div id="q2" class="answer">
        <p><strong>Relationship between PMR and GCA:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>PMR and GCA are closely related conditions, considered part of the same disease spectrum</li>
          <li>They share similar demographics (age >50, peak 70-80 years, more common in women, Northern European ancestry)</li>
          <li><strong>15-20% of PMR patients develop GCA</strong></li>
          <li><strong>40-60% of GCA patients have PMR symptoms</strong></li>
          <li>Both have similar inflammatory markers (elevated ESR/CRP) and respond to corticosteroids</li>
          <li>Temporal artery biopsies in PMR patients without GCA symptoms sometimes show subclinical arteritis</li>
          <li>Consider them as overlapping conditions: isolated PMR, PMR + GCA, or isolated GCA</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) - typical features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> Almost always >50 years (mean age 70 years)</li>
          <li><strong>Pain and stiffness:</strong> Bilateral shoulder and pelvic girdle (neck, shoulders, upper arms, hips, thighs)</li>
          <li><strong>Morning stiffness:</strong> Marked, lasting >45 minutes (typically several hours)</li>
          <li><strong>Functional impairment:</strong> Difficulty with activities - rising from chair, lifting arms above head, getting dressed</li>
          <li><strong>Systemic symptoms:</strong> Fatigue, malaise, low-grade fever, weight loss, depression</li>
          <li><strong>Onset:</strong> Usually subacute (over weeks), can be acute</li>
          <li><strong>Important negative findings:</strong> No muscle weakness on testing (pain limits movement, not weakness), peripheral joints generally spared</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA/Temporal Arteritis) - typical features:</strong></p>

        <p><em>Cranial symptoms (most common):</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Headache (70%):</strong> New onset, severe, temporal or occipital, may be continuous</li>
          <li><strong>Scalp tenderness:</strong> Pain when combing hair or resting head on pillow</li>
          <li><strong>Jaw claudication (40%):</strong> Pain in jaw/tongue with chewing, pathognomonic when present</li>
          <li><strong>Visual symptoms (25-50%):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Amaurosis fugax (transient visual loss - warning symptom)</li>
              <li>Diplopia (extraocular muscle ischemia)</li>
              <li>Permanent visual loss (AION - anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, central retinal artery occlusion)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Temporal artery abnormalities:</strong> Prominent, tender, reduced/absent pulsation, may be nodular</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Systemic symptoms:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fever, malaise, weight loss, night sweats (constitutional symptoms in 50%)</li>
          <li>PMR symptoms (in 40-60%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Large vessel involvement (less common but important):</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aortic aneurysm/dissection</li>
          <li>Limb claudication (subclavian, axillary, brachial arteries)</li>
          <li>Asymmetric blood pressures/pulses in arms</li>
          <li>Stroke (carotid/vertebral involvement)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key distinguishing features:</strong> Headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, and temporal artery abnormalities suggest GCA. PMR alone has predominantly musculoskeletal symptoms without cranial features.</p>

        <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
        <strong>Question 3:</strong> What investigations are used to diagnose PMR and GCA? Discuss the role of temporal artery biopsy and the limitations of diagnostic tests.
      </button>
      <div id="q3" class="answer">
        <p><strong>Blood tests (both PMR and GCA):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ESR and CRP:</strong> Typically markedly elevated
            <ul>
              <li>PMR: ESR usually >40 mm/hr (often 40-100)</li>
              <li>GCA: ESR often >50 mm/hr (frequently >100, can be >100)</li>
              <li>However, ~20% of GCA patients have ESR &lt;50</li>
              <li>CRP usually elevated in parallel with ESR</li>
              <li><strong>Normal inflammatory markers do NOT exclude GCA if clinical suspicion is high</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>FBC:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Normochromic normocytic anaemia (anaemia of chronic disease)</li>
              <li>Thrombocytosis (reactive)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>LFTs:</strong> Alkaline phosphatase may be elevated (particularly in GCA)</li>
          <li><strong>Other tests to exclude differential diagnoses:</strong> Rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, CK (normal in PMR - excludes myositis), thyroid function, protein electrophoresis, urinalysis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Temporal artery biopsy (gold standard for GCA):</strong></p>

        <p><em>Indications:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Suspected GCA (cranial symptoms, visual symptoms, or PMR with high inflammatory markers)</li>
          <li>To confirm diagnosis, especially if long-term steroids anticipated</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Procedure and findings:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sample at least 1-2cm length (skip lesions can be missed with short samples)</li>
          <li>Unilateral biopsy is usually sufficient; if negative but high clinical suspicion, consider contralateral biopsy</li>
          <li><strong>Histology shows:</strong> Granulomatous inflammation, multinucleated giant cells, disruption of internal elastic lamina, intimal hyperplasia</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Timing:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Should NOT delay treatment</strong> - start steroids immediately on clinical suspicion</li>
          <li>Biopsy should ideally be performed within 7 days of starting steroids (remains positive up to 2-4 weeks in many cases)</li>
          <li>Changes on biopsy may disappear after prolonged steroid treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Limitations:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sensitivity only 60-90%</strong> (due to skip lesions - patchy arterial involvement)</li>
          <li>False negatives occur - negative biopsy does NOT exclude GCA if clinical suspicion is high</li>
          <li>Positive biopsy confirms diagnosis, but treatment decisions are clinical</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Imaging (increasingly used, especially if biopsy not available/contraindicated):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temporal artery ultrasound:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Non-invasive, can be performed quickly</li>
              <li>Characteristic "halo sign" (hypoechoic wall thickening due to edema)</li>
              <li>Operator-dependent, requires experienced sonographer</li>
              <li>Sensitivity ~75%, specificity ~83%</li>
              <li>Can be used to guide biopsy site</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>MRI/MRA, CT angiography, PET-CT:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Useful for detecting large vessel involvement (aorta, subclavian, carotid arteries)</li>
              <li>PET-CT shows increased FDG uptake in inflamed vessel walls</li>
              <li>Can identify aortic aneurysms/complications</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Diagnostic criteria for PMR (BSR/BHPR 2010 provisional criteria include):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Age ≥50 years</li>
          <li>Bilateral shoulder and/or pelvic girdle aching</li>
          <li>Morning stiffness >45 minutes</li>
          <li>Elevated ESR/CRP</li>
          <li>Rapid response to prednisolone (≤20mg/day)</li>
          <li>Exclusion of other diagnoses</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clinical diagnosis:</strong> Both PMR and GCA remain largely <strong>clinical diagnoses</strong>. Investigations support the diagnosis but should not delay treatment in GCA. A dramatic response to corticosteroids is characteristic and supports the diagnosis.</p>

        <strong>Question 4:</strong> Outline the corticosteroid treatment regimen for PMR and GCA. How do you monitor response and manage steroid tapering?
      </button>
      <div id="q4" class="answer">
        <p><strong>Corticosteroid treatment for GCA:</strong></p>

        <p><em>Acute phase:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>With visual symptoms (emergency):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>IV methylprednisolone 500mg-1g daily for 3 days</li>
              <li>Then oral prednisolone 40-60mg daily</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Without visual symptoms:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Oral prednisolone 40-60mg daily (some use up to 1mg/kg)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Expected response:</strong> Dramatic improvement in symptoms within 24-72 hours (if no response, reconsider diagnosis)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Tapering regimen (BSR guidelines):</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weeks 0-4:</strong> High dose (40-60mg)</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 4-8:</strong> Reduce to 20mg daily (if symptoms controlled and CRP normalizing)</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 8-12:</strong> Reduce to 15mg daily</li>
          <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Reduce by 2.5mg every 2-4 weeks to 10mg</li>
          <li><strong>Months 6-12:</strong> Reduce by 1mg every 1-2 months</li>
          <li><strong>After month 12:</strong> Continue slow taper by 0.5-1mg every 1-2 months</li>
          <li><strong>Total duration:</strong> Typically 1-2 years, but many patients need longer (individualized)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Corticosteroid treatment for PMR (without GCA):</strong></p>

        <p><em>Initial dose:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prednisolone 15mg daily</strong> (range 12.5-25mg, but avoid >25mg - suggests alternative diagnosis)</li>
          <li><strong>Expected response:</strong> Marked improvement within days (70% respond within 1 week); lack of response should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Tapering regimen (BSR guidelines):</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weeks 0-3:</strong> 15mg daily</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 3-6:</strong> Reduce to 12.5mg daily</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 6-12:</strong> Reduce to 10mg daily</li>
          <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Reduce by 1mg every 4-8 weeks (slow taper)</li>
          <li><strong>After 10mg reached:</strong> Reduce by 1mg every 4-8 weeks or 0.5mg every 4-8 weeks below 5mg</li>
          <li><strong>Total duration:</strong> Typically 1-2 years (range 6 months to several years)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Monitoring during treatment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clinical symptoms:</strong> Most important - recurrence of symptoms indicates active disease</li>
          <li><strong>ESR/CRP:</strong> Monitor regularly (every 4-8 weeks during tapering, more frequently if concerns)
            <ul>
              <li>Should normalize on treatment</li>
              <li>Rising ESR/CRP may indicate relapse (but can also be due to infection or other causes)</li>
              <li>Some patients have persistently elevated ESR without clinical relapse</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Watch for GCA symptoms in PMR patients:</strong> Headache, visual symptoms, jaw claudication (requires immediate increase in steroids)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Managing relapses:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Relapse definition:</strong> Recurrence of symptoms (with or without rising inflammatory markers)</li>
          <li><strong>Management:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase prednisolone to last effective dose (or higher if symptoms severe)</li>
              <li>If GCA symptoms: treat as initial presentation (40-60mg)</li>
              <li>Resume tapering once remission re-achieved (slower taper may be needed)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>~50% of PMR patients and higher proportion of GCA patients experience relapse during tapering</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steroid-sparing agents (consider if):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relapsing disease requiring high steroid doses</li>
          <li>Unable to taper below 7.5-10mg prednisolone</li>
          <li>Significant steroid-related side effects</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Options:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Methotrexate:</strong> 7.5-25mg weekly (modest steroid-sparing effect, limited evidence)</li>
          <li><strong>Tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor):</strong> Licensed for GCA (particularly refractory/relapsing cases); 162mg SC weekly or fortnightly
            <ul>
              <li>Proven to increase remission rates and reduce cumulative steroid dose</li>
              <li>Expensive, usually reserved for difficult cases</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Azathioprine, leflunomide: limited evidence, occasionally used</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Co-prescribing with steroids:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bone protection:</strong> Calcium + vitamin D, bisphosphonate (if high fracture risk or prolonged steroids anticipated)</li>
          <li><strong>Gastroprotection:</strong> PPI (especially if other GI risk factors)</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Blood glucose, BP, bone density (DEXA scan), eye checks (cataracts, glaucoma)</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Advise regular weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, falls prevention</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key principles:</strong> Tailored tapering based on clinical response (not just ESR/CRP); slow taper reduces relapse risk; never abruptly stop steroids after prolonged use (adrenal suppression).</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Permanent visual loss (15-20% if untreated):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) - most common cause</li>
              <li>Central retinal artery occlusion</li>
              <li>Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy</li>
              <li>Cortical blindness (occipital lobe infarction)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Bilateral involvement:</strong> High risk of second eye being affected within days if not treated (30-50% become bilateral)</li>
          <li>Diplopia (extraocular muscle ischemia)</li>
          <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Immediate high-dose steroids dramatically reduce risk of visual loss</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Neurological complications:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stroke (3-7%):</strong> Carotid or vertebral artery involvement</li>
          <li>Transient ischemic attacks</li>
          <li>Cranial nerve palsies</li>
          <li>Peripheral neuropathy (less common)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Large vessel complications:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thoracic aortic aneurysm:</strong> 17x increased risk (may present years after initial diagnosis)</li>
          <li>Aortic dissection</li>
          <li>Limb ischemia (subclavian, axillary artery stenosis/occlusion)</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term monitoring:</strong> Annual chest X-ray or periodic imaging of thoracic aorta recommended by some experts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Other complications:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jaw/tongue necrosis (rare, from severe ischemia)</li>
          <li>Scalp necrosis (rare)</li>
          <li>Myocardial infarction</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy (very common - almost all patients on long-term steroids experience some):</strong></p>

        <p><em>Endocrine/metabolic:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weight gain and central obesity (very common):</strong> Increased appetite, fat redistribution (Cushingoid appearance)</li>
          <li><strong>Diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance:</strong> Monitor blood glucose regularly; may need oral hypoglycemics or insulin</li>
          <li><strong>Adrenal suppression:</strong> After prolonged use (\&gt;3 weeks); risk of adrenal crisis if steroids stopped abruptly or during acute illness
            <ul>
              <li>Patients need steroid alert card/bracelet</li>
              <li>May need temporary increase during illness/surgery</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Dyslipidemia</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Musculoskeletal:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Osteoporosis and fragility fractures (common):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Bone loss most rapid in first 3-6 months of therapy</li>
              <li>Vertebral fractures particularly common</li>
              <li><strong>Prevention essential:</strong> Calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, DEXA monitoring</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Myopathy:</strong> Proximal muscle weakness (distinguish from PMR symptoms - myopathy causes true weakness)</li>
          <li>Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis), especially femoral head</li>
          <li>Tendon rupture (Achilles particularly)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Cardiovascular:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hypertension (common):</strong> Monitor BP regularly; may need antihypertensives</li>
          <li>Increased cardiovascular risk (MI, heart failure)</li>
          <li>Peripheral edema</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Gastrointestinal:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peptic ulceration and GI bleeding:</strong> Risk increased, especially with NSAIDs; consider PPI prophylaxis</li>
          <li>Dyspepsia</li>
          <li>Pancreatitis (rare)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Ophthalmic:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cataracts (common with prolonged use):</strong> Posterior subcapsular cataracts typical</li>
          <li><strong>Glaucoma:</strong> Increased intraocular pressure</li>
          <li>Regular ophthalmology screening recommended</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Dermatological:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Skin thinning and easy bruising (very common)</li>
          <li>Striae</li>
          <li>Delayed wound healing</li>
          <li>Acne</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Immunological:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Increased infection risk:</strong> Particularly opportunistic infections at higher doses
            <ul>
              <li>Consider pneumococcal and annual flu vaccination</li>
              <li>Avoid live vaccines while on immunosuppression</li>
              <li>Be vigilant for atypical presentations of infection (steroids may mask fever)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Neuropsychiatric:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mood changes (euphoria, depression, irritability)</li>
          <li>Insomnia (advise taking morning dose)</li>
          <li>Psychosis (rare but serious)</li>
          <li>Cognitive impairment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Patient counseling and monitoring strategy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Explain the risk-benefit balance:</strong> Serious complications of untreated GCA (blindness, stroke) far outweigh steroid risks, but long-term side effects are almost inevitable and need proactive management</li>
          <li><strong>Provide steroid alert card</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Advise NOT to stop abruptly</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Regular monitoring:</strong> BP, blood glucose, bone density, weight, mood, infections</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle measures:</strong> Healthy diet, exercise, smoking cessation, falls prevention, adequate calcium/vitamin D intake</li>
          <li><strong>Report warning symptoms:</strong> Visual changes, severe headache (disease relapse); signs of infection or new symptoms (steroid complications)</li>
          <li>Long-term follow-up essential</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Key message:</strong> While steroids carry significant long-term risks, they are life- and sight-saving in GCA. The goal is to use the minimum effective dose for the shortest necessary duration while implementing measures to mitigate steroid-related complications.</p>
