    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. Describe the features of renal adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Renal adenocarcinoma (Renal cell carcinoma)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Male to female ratio 2:1. Peak incidence sixth and seventh decades. 2% of all adult malignancies.</li>
          <li><strong>Aetiology:</strong> Cigarette smoking doubles the risk. Obesity, hypertension, unopposed oestrogen therapy and chronic renal failure are associated with an increased risk. Von Hippel-Lindau disease (mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3) – autosomal dominant disorder. Adult polycystic kidney disease – increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma.</li>
          <li><strong>Pathology:</strong> 85% arise from proximal tubular epithelium (clear cell adenocarcinoma). Remaining 15% derived from distal tubule cells.</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical presentation:</strong> Classic triad of loin pain, haematuria and an abdominal mass (occurs in less than 15% of patients). Haematuria is the most common presenting symptom. Systemic symptoms include fever, night sweats, malaise and weight loss. Polycythaemia (increased erythropoietin production), hypercalcaemia (PTH-related peptide secretion), hypertension (increased renin production). Varicocele – tumour invasion/occlusion of testicular vein (more commonly left sided). Stauffer's syndrome – syndrome of hepatic dysfunction in the absence of metastatic disease. Reverses after nephrectomy. Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or hepatomegaly due to metastatic spread. 25-30% of patients present with metastatic disease.</li>
          <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> FBC (anaemia or polycythaemia), Renal function (urea, creatinine, electrolytes), Serum calcium, LFTs. CT scan – investigation of choice. Chest X-ray to look for cannonball metastases.</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Radical nephrectomy for organ-confined disease. Immunotherapy with IL-2 and INF alpha for metastatic disease. Radiotherapy for bone metastases.</li>
          <li><strong>Prognosis:</strong> Prognosis is related to tumour stage. 5-year survival for stage I disease approaches 95%, and that for stage IV disease is only 10%. Overall 5-year survival for renal cell carcinoma is approximately 50%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Transitional cell carcinoma (Urothelial carcinoma)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Most common malignancy of the urinary tract. Male:female ratio 3:1. Peak incidence sixth and seventh decades. 90% of bladder tumours are transitional cell carcinomas. Transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter) is much less common.</li>
          <li><strong>Aetiology:</strong> Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor and accounts for 50% of cases. Occupational exposure to aniline dyes, rubber, and chemicals used in cable and paint industries. Chronic inflammation: long-term catheterization, bladder calculi, schistosomiasis (associated with squamous cell carcinoma). Drugs: phenacetin, cyclophosphamide. Pelvic irradiation.</li>
          <li><strong>Pathology:</strong> Transitional cell carcinoma can be papillary (75%), solid (20%) or mixed (5%). Papillary tumours are usually low-grade and have a good prognosis. Solid tumours are usually high-grade and have a poorer prognosis.</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical presentation:</strong> Painless macroscopic haematuria is the most common presenting symptom (85%). Frequency, urgency and dysuria may occur if there is carcinoma in situ. Ureteric obstruction may cause loin pain and hydronephrosis.</li>
          <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> Urine cytology (low sensitivity for low-grade tumours). CT urography. Cystoscopy and biopsy – definitive diagnosis and to determine extent of disease.</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Superficial bladder cancer (stages Ta, Tis, T1): transurethral resection (TURBT). Intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy (BCG) to reduce risk of recurrence. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages T2-T4): radical cystectomy with urinary diversion OR radiotherapy with chemotherapy (bladder preservation). Metastatic disease: systemic chemotherapy.</li>
          <li><strong>Prognosis:</strong> 5-year survival for superficial disease is 80-90%. 5-year survival for muscle-invasive disease is 50%. Transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract has a poorer prognosis than bladder cancer.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Describe the features of Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in PKD1 gene (chromosome 16) account for 85% of cases. PKD2 gene (chromosome 4) mutations account for 15% of cases. PKD1 disease tends to be more severe with earlier onset of renal failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> 1 in 1000. Accounts for 10% of patients with end-stage renal failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Pathology:</strong> Progressive development of multiple fluid-filled cysts in both kidneys. Cysts arise from all parts of the nephron and progressively enlarge. Normal renal tissue is compressed and eventually destroyed. Kidneys may become massively enlarged.</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical presentation:</strong> Usually asymptomatic until middle age (30-50 years). Chronic loin pain or an abdominal mass. Haematuria (rupture of cyst into collecting system). Acute loin pain (haemorrhage into cyst, cyst infection, renal calculi – occur in 20%). Hypertension occurs in 60% before the onset of renal failure. Progressive decline in renal function leading to end-stage renal failure (usually by 60 years of age). UTIs and pyelonephritis are common.</li>
          <li><strong>Extra-renal manifestations:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>Hepatic cysts (most common extra-renal manifestation – present in 30%)</li>
              <li>Intracranial berry aneurysms (5-10%). Risk of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Screen with MR angiography if family history of aneurysms or subarachnoid haemorrhage</li>
              <li>Mitral valve prolapse (25%)</li>
              <li>Aortic regurgitation</li>
              <li>Colonic diverticulae</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Ultrasound is the investigation of choice (renal cysts visible). CT or MRI if ultrasound is equivocal. Genetic testing for PKD1 and PKD2 mutations.</li>
          <li><strong>Management:</strong> No specific treatment to prevent cyst formation or slow progression of disease. Blood pressure control is essential (ACE inhibitors or ARBs first-line). Treat UTIs aggressively. Pain management (simple analgesics, cyst aspiration, rarely nephrectomy). Renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) for end-stage renal failure.</li>
          <li><strong>Screening:</strong> Screen family members with ultrasound. Genetic counselling.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Paraneoplastic syndromes:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Hypercalcaemia (due to bone metastases or PTH-related peptide secretion) – causes polyuria, dehydration, AKI</li>
              <li>Tumour lysis syndrome (especially after chemotherapy for haematological malignancies) – hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia – can cause AKI</li>

              <li>Renal biopsy: necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (pauci-immune – minimal Ig deposition)</li>
              <li>Treatment: high-dose corticosteroids + cyclophosphamide or rituximab for induction. Maintenance with azathioprine or rituximab. Plasma exchange in severe disease</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Medium vessel vasculitis:</strong> Polyarteritis nodosa – can cause renal infarction, AKI, hypertension</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Renal involvement occurs in 50% of patients with SLE. Lupus nephritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE</li>

              <li>Class I – Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis</li>
              <li>Class II – Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis</li>
              <li>Class III – Focal lupus nephritis (\&lt;50% of glomeruli)</li>
              <li>Class IV – Diffuse lupus nephritis (≥50% of glomeruli) – most severe form</li>
              <li>Class V – Membranous lupus nephritis</li>
              <li>Class VI – Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> Urinalysis (haematuria, proteinuria, cellular casts). Urine protein:creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein. Renal function (urea, creatinine, eGFR).
