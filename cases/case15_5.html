    <h1>Case 15.5 – Personality Disorders</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Mental Health and Human Behaviour | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Psychiatry | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Jack Archer, 22-year-old, is a frequent attender to your general practice and usually presents with trivial symptoms. You have had to deal with Jack calling you or the receptionists after hours and sometimes texting you at night. When Jack does attend, he tends to be demanding and critical of yourself and the nursing staff. He has been through several GPs in the practice over the last year.</p>

    <p>Jack walks in and demands you write a script for alprazolam right away.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. How would you respond to Jack when he demands a prescription of alprazolam?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Responding to Prescribing Demands:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to stay calm</li>
          <li>Speak in a clear and unhurried manner</li>
          <li>Explain you would be happy to help Jack with his symptoms, but first need to ask him a few questions to determine what is going on</li>
          <li>Explain that you need to do this to ensure that the treatment you provide him with is the right treatment, and will help him with his symptoms</li>
          <li>Explain that alprazolam can be a helpful medication for certain symptoms, however for some conditions there are more appropriate medications</li>
          <li>State that at the moment you are not able to write him a script for alprazolam, but perhaps after assessing him you will be able to help him</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Principles of Assessment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to establish a rapport with Jack</li>
          <li>Try to determine what Jack's symptoms are</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any current or past substance abuse issues</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any signs of current intoxication</li>
          <li>If intoxicated or under the influence of a substance, ascertain what substance is involved</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has had alprazolam before, and what he has used it for</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any other reasons for coming in today</li>
          <li>Determine whether Jack has any safety concerns (i.e., is he at risk of harm to self or others)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Safety:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure there are other staff members are aware that Jack is in your room</li>
          <li>Ensure there is an avenue of escape (i.e., don't allow Jack to sit between you and the door)</li>
          <li>Know where your duress button is</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>Jack is not intoxicated. When you try to explore what his symptoms are, he is vague. He does mention that his girlfriend broke up with him and that he feels like hurting himself. You ask Jack further questions and he becomes increasingly hostile and says the other doctors in the practice are much better and would have given him what he needs already.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What is your differential diagnosis? Would you consider a substance misuse disorder? What about a personality disorder?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Differential Diagnosis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Substance misuse disorder:</strong> Possible, given his demanding behavior for benzodiazepines and vague symptom presentation</li>
          <li><strong>Personality disorder:</strong> Pattern of difficult interpersonal relationships, frequent attendance, boundary violations (after-hours contact), splitting behavior with doctors</li>
          <li><strong>Mood disorder:</strong> Depression or bipolar disorder should be considered</li>
          <li><strong>Anxiety disorder:</strong> Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustment disorder:</strong> Related to relationship breakdown</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Personality Disorders - Overview:</strong></p>
        <p>Personality disorders are a collection of disorders characterised by enduring maladaptive patterns of behaviour, cognition, and inner experience. These patterns develop early, are inflexible, and are associated with significant distress and impairment.</p>

        <p><strong>DSM-5 Classification - Three Clusters:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Cluster A (Odd/Eccentric):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Paranoid PD:</strong> Pattern of distrust and suspiciousness</li>
          <li><strong>Schizoid PD:</strong> Pattern of detachment from social relationships</li>
          <li><strong>Schizotypal PD:</strong> Pattern of acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, eccentricities of behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cluster B (Dramatic/Emotional/Erratic):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Antisocial PD:</strong> Pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others</li>
          <li><strong>Borderline PD:</strong> Pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects, and marked impulsivity</li>
          <li><strong>Histrionic PD:</strong> Pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking</li>
          <li><strong>Narcissistic PD:</strong> Pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cluster C (Anxious/Fearful):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Avoidant PD:</strong> Pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to negative evaluation</li>
          <li><strong>Dependent PD:</strong> Pattern of submissive and clinging behavior related to excessive need to be taken care of</li>
          <li><strong>Obsessive-Compulsive PD:</strong> Pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, mental and interpersonal control</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Borderline Personality Disorder - Key Features:</strong></p>
        <p>Most relevant to Jack's presentation. Characterized by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment</li>
          <li>Pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships (idealization and devaluation)</li>
          <li>Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image</li>
          <li>Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)</li>
          <li>Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior</li>
          <li>Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood</li>
          <li>Chronic feelings of emptiness</li>
          <li>Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger</li>
          <li>Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Assessment Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jack's behavior shows splitting (other doctors are "much better")</li>
          <li>Difficulty maintaining relationships (multiple GP changes)</li>
          <li>Boundary violations (after-hours contact)</li>
          <li>Impulsivity and demanding behavior</li>
          <li>Mention of self-harm following relationship breakdown</li>
          <li>These features suggest possible Cluster B personality disorder, particularly borderline PD</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>Jack's behaviour escalates and he starts to become more aggressive, threatening to hurt you if you don't give him what he wants.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. How will you manage this situation if Jack's behaviour becomes violent?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Immediate Safety Priorities:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Your safety comes first</strong></li>
          <li>Do not put yourself at risk</li>
          <li>Do not attempt to physically restrain or confront an aggressive patient</li>
          <li>Your goal is de-escalation, not confrontation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>De-escalation Techniques:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Maintain calm body language and tone of voice</li>
          <li><strong>Give space:</strong> Don't stand too close or make threatening gestures</li>
          <li><strong>Non-threatening posture:</strong> Keep hands visible, open body language</li>
          <li><strong>Speak slowly and clearly:</strong> Use simple, direct statements</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge feelings:</strong> "I can see you're upset"</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid arguing:</strong> Don't debate or become defensive</li>
          <li><strong>Offer choices:</strong> Give the patient some sense of control</li>
          <li><strong>Set limits:</strong> "I want to help you, but I need you to sit down and stop shouting"</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If De-escalation Fails:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use duress alarm immediately</strong></li>
          <li>Move toward the exit if possible</li>
          <li>Call for help from colleagues</li>
          <li>Leave the room if you feel unsafe</li>
          <li>Call security or police (000) if violence is imminent or occurs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>After the Incident:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure your safety and that of staff and other patients</li>
          <li>Seek support from colleagues</li>
          <li>Document the incident thoroughly</li>
          <li>Report to practice manager/appropriate authorities</li>
          <li>Consider police report if assault occurred</li>
          <li>Debrief with team</li>
          <li>Access support services if needed (e.g., counseling)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Legal Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to terminate the doctor-patient relationship if threatened</li>
          <li>Document reasons clearly</li>
          <li>Provide written notification to patient</li>
          <li>Offer to transfer care appropriately (but not required if safety concern)</li>
          <li>Ensure other practice staff are aware</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Practice Policies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have clear workplace violence policy</li>
          <li>Regular staff training on managing aggression</li>
          <li>Clear procedures for using duress alarms</li>
          <li>Support systems for staff who experience violence</li>
          <li>Physical environment considerations (exit access, panic buttons, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>Jack eventually calms down and leaves the practice. Later that evening he sends you several text messages apologising for his behaviour, and praising you as the best doctor he has ever had.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. How will you manage this situation going forward?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Immediate Response to Text Messages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not respond to personal text messages</li>
          <li>This represents a boundary violation</li>
          <li>Responding encourages further inappropriate contact</li>
          <li>Document that you received the messages</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Setting Professional Boundaries:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrange a consultation to discuss the incident and ongoing care</li>
          <li>Explain clearly what acceptable contact methods are (e.g., calling reception during business hours)</li>
          <li>Inform Jack that personal text messages are not appropriate</li>
          <li>Explain that after-hours contact should be for emergencies only</li>
          <li>Outline consequences if boundaries continue to be violated</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jack's behavior shows classic "splitting" - alternating between idealization ("best doctor") and devaluation (previous hostility)</li>
          <li>This is characteristic of borderline personality disorder</li>
          <li>Recognize this pattern to avoid being manipulated</li>
          <li>Don't accept the idealization any more than you took the criticism personally</li>
          <li>Maintain consistent, professional boundaries regardless of Jack's behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Ongoing Management Strategies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintain same boundaries and expectations regardless of Jack's behavior</li>
          <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> Be explicit about expectations and limits</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Keep detailed records of all interactions</li>
          <li><strong>Team approach:</strong> Ensure all practice staff are aware of the situation and boundaries</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment plan:</strong> Develop a clear, written treatment plan with Jack's input</li>
          <li><strong>Regular appointments:</strong> Scheduled consultations rather than crisis presentations</li>
          <li><strong>Mental health referral:</strong> Strongly consider referral to psychiatrist or psychologist</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Consider Terminating the Doctor-Patient Relationship If:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boundaries continue to be violated despite clear communication</li>
          <li>You or staff continue to feel unsafe</li>
          <li>The therapeutic relationship is not viable</li>
          <li>Jack is unable or unwilling to engage appropriately</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If Terminating Relationship:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide written notification to Jack</li>
          <li>Clearly document reasons</li>
          <li>Offer to provide ongoing care for a reasonable transition period (e.g., 30 days)</li>
          <li>Provide list of alternative providers if possible</li>
          <li>Ensure all practice staff are informed</li>
          <li>Be prepared for possible complaint to medical board</li>
          <li>Seek advice from medical defense organization if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Referral Options:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Psychiatrist - for assessment and management of personality disorder</li>
          <li>Psychologist - for evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy for borderline PD)</li>
          <li>Community mental health services</li>
          <li>Crisis teams if acute risk remains</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Self-Care:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss challenging cases with colleagues</li>
          <li>Recognize your emotional response is normal</li>
          <li>Don't feel obligated to continue care if relationship is not therapeutic</li>
          <li>Access support through GP support services if needed</li>
          <li>Maintain professional boundaries for your own wellbeing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Learning Points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personality disorders present significant management challenges</li>
          <li>Consistency and clear boundaries are essential</li>
          <li>Don't take idealization or devaluation personally</li>
          <li>Recognize when a therapeutic relationship is not viable</li>
          <li>Your safety and wellbeing matter</li>
          <li>Multidisciplinary approach is often needed</li>
          <li>Documentation protects both you and the patient</li>
