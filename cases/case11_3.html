    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. What are the current recommendations for breast cancer screening in asymptomatic women in Australia?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This position statement applies to <strong>screening methods</strong> for the early detection of breast cancer in <strong>asymptomatic women</strong>, it does NOT apply to diagnostic tests used to assess women presenting with breast changes.</p>

        <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
        <p>Detection of breast cancer while it is still small and confined to the breast provides the best chance of effective treatment. Benefits of early detection include increased survival, increased treatment options and improved quality of life. For women, <strong>age remains the biggest risk factor</strong> in the development of breast cancer with over 70% of cases found in women aged 50 years and older. However, in younger women, tumours are likely to be larger and more aggressive and overall survival is lower than for older women with the disease.</p>

        <h3>Early Detection Methods</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Breast awareness</strong> - awareness by a woman of the normal look and feel of her breasts</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical breast examination</strong> - physical examination of an asymptomatic woman's breasts by a medical professional</li>
          <li><strong>Screening mammography</strong> - use of mammography in asymptomatic women to detect breast cancer at an early stage (BreastScreen Australia is the national mammographic screening program)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations for Women at Population Risk</h3>
        <p>(Population risk = level of risk of developing breast cancer for women in the general population - currently estimated 1/11)</p>

        <p><strong>1. Breast Awareness</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommended</strong> that women of all ages, and regardless of whether they attend for mammographic screening, are aware of how their breasts normally look and feel and report any new or unusual changes promptly to their general practitioner</li>
          <li>No one method for women to use when checking their breasts is recommended over another</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. Clinical Breast Examination</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A firm recommendation regarding clinical breast examination is <strong>not possible</strong> as there is no evidence to either encourage or discourage the use of clinical breast examination as a screening method for women of any age</li>
          <li>Women who are eligible and attending for regular mammographic screening should be aware that there is no evidence that clinical breast examination will provide additional benefit</li>
          <li>Women who are not attending regular mammographic screening may gain some benefit from regular clinical breast examination</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Mammographic Screening</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Women younger than 40 years:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mammographic screening is <strong>NOT recommended</strong> for women younger than 40 years of age</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Women aged 40-49 years:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eligible</strong> for free two-yearly screening mammograms through the BreastScreen Australia Program (although they are not targeted by the Program)</li>
          <li>In deciding whether to attend for screening mammography, women in this age group should <strong>balance the potential benefits and downsides</strong> for them, considering the evidence that screening mammography is less effective for women in this age group than for older women</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Women aged 50-69 years:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> that women aged 50-69 years attend the BreastScreen Australia Program for free two-yearly screening mammograms</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Women aged 70 years and older:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eligible</strong> for free two-yearly screening mammograms through the BreastScreen Australia Program</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recommendations for Women at Increased Risk</h3>
        <p>(Strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, gene mutation carriers, DCIS or other high-risk pre-invasive breast disease)</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Individualised surveillance program</strong> be developed in consultation with the woman's general practitioner and/or specialist</li>
          <li>This might include regular clinical breast examination and breast imaging with mammography and/or ultrasound</li>
          <li>Women should also be aware of the normal look and feel of their breasts and report any changes promptly to their general practitioner or specialist irrespective of whether they are having regular follow-up tests/examinations</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. How would you evaluate a 38 year old woman who presents with a "breast mass"?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Triple Assessment:</strong></p>
        <p>Any palpable breast abnormality should be assessed by the process of <strong>triple assessment</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clinical evaluation</li>
          <li>Radiological evaluation</li>
          <li>Cytological/histological evaluation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1. Clinical Evaluation</h3>

        <p><strong>History:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nature of the breast mass (duration, changes, pain, discharge)</li>
          <li>Risk factors:
            <ul>
              <li>Family history</li>
              <li>Menstrual and reproductive history</li>
              <li>Use of hormones (OCP, HRT)</li>
              <li>Personal history of breast cancer or breast disease</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Physical Examination:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspection and palpation of the <strong>entire breast</strong> and <strong>lymph node-bearing areas</strong></li>
          <li>Features of mass: <strong>position, size, consistency</strong> and any <strong>fixation to surrounding deep or superficial structures</strong></li>
          <li>Should the patient complain of discharge, then an attempt to reproduce this should be made. Any discharge that is obtained should be:
            <ul>
              <li>Tested for blood using a reagent stick</li>
              <li>Sent for cytological examination</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Radiological Evaluation</h3>

        <p><strong>Mammography:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generally, mammography in women <strong>under 35 years</strong> is often not helpful because they have particularly <strong>dense breasts</strong> at this age which can mask any underlying tumours and make interpretation very difficult</li>
          <li>However, it <strong>should be done if there is clinical suspicion of malignancy</strong></li>
          <li>Mammographic abnormalities that warrant further investigation include:
            <ul>
              <li>Radiological masses undetected on clinical examination</li>
              <li>Microcalcifications</li>
              <li>Stellate densities</li>
              <li>Architectural distortion</li>
              <li>Change from a previous mammogram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Ultrasound:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Useful in <strong>discriminating solid from cystic masses</strong> and especially in the evaluation of the dense breast</li>
          <li>Other uses include ultrasound-guided biopsy or needle localisation</li>
          <li>In younger women, <strong>ultrasound may reveal more information than mammography</strong>, and most surgeons would perform this test first in women less than 35</li>
          <li>Masses smaller than 5-10 mm may not be visualised, and masses in fatty breasts are also difficult to assess</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>MRI:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Further research is being done to evaluate the role of breast MRI in the clinical setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Cytological/Histological Evaluation</h3>

        <p><strong>Needle aspiration and cytology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For impalpable lesions, stereotactic techniques can be used to localise the lesion for needle aspiration</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Core needle biopsy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The method provides a sample of tissue for <strong>histological rather than cytological examination</strong></li>
          <li>The pathological diagnosis should be more certain because cellular architecture can be assessed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Excision biopsy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removal of all gross evidence of disease with a small rim of normal breast tissue</li>
          <li>If the tumour is small enough, all macroscopic disease is removed, but the primary objective is for diagnostic purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Incision biopsy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Similar to excision biopsy except that only a part of the lump is removed</li>
          <li>Generally felt that this is not good surgical practice</li>
          <li>Use restricted to larger tumours</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Wire-guided biopsy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Screening mammography demonstrates many clinically impalpable lesions</li>
          <li>To localise these, a marking wire is placed under mammographic guidance before surgical excision</li>
          <li>The tissue around the wire is then excised and further imaging done to ensure that the indicated lesion has in fact been removed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Ultrasound-guided biopsy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both the technique of needle-guided biopsy and real-time cyst aspiration can be used</li>
          <li>Techniques depend on the expertise available</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Summarise the vascular supply, neural supply, and lymphatic drainage of the breast.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Arterial Supply</h3>
        <p>The breast is related to the thoracic wall and to structures associated with the upper limb; therefore, vascular supply and drainage can occur by multiple routes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Laterally</strong>, vessels from the <strong>axillary artery</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Superior thoracic artery</li>
              <li>Thoraco-acromial artery</li>
              <li>Lateral thoracic artery</li>
              <li>Subscapular artery</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Medially</strong>, branches from the <strong>internal thoracic artery</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>second to fourth intercostal arteries</strong> via branches that perforate the thoracic wall and overlying muscle</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Venous Drainage</h3>
        <p>Veins draining the breast parallel the arteries and ultimately drain into the <strong>axillary, internal thoracic, and intercostal veins</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Innervation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Innervation of the breast is via <strong>anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the second to sixth intercostal nerves</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>nipple</strong> is innervated by the <strong>fourth intercostal nerve</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
        <p>Lymphatic drainage of the breast is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Approximately <strong>75%</strong> is via lymphatic vessels that drain <strong>laterally and superiorly into axillary nodes</strong></li>
          <li>Most of the remaining drainage is into <strong>parasternal nodes</strong> deep to the anterior thoracic wall and associated with the internal thoracic artery</li>
          <li>Some drainage may occur via lymphatic vessels that follow the lateral branches of <strong>posterior intercostal arteries</strong> and connect with <strong>intercostal nodes</strong> situated near the heads and necks of ribs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Further Drainage:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Axillary nodes drain into the <strong>subclavian trunks</strong></li>
          <li>Parasternal nodes drain into the <strong>bronchomediastinal trunks</strong></li>
          <li>Intercostal nodes drain either into the <strong>thoracic duct</strong> or into the <strong>bronchomediastinal trunks</strong></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. What is the rationale for sentinel lymph node biopsy in the surgical treatment of early breast cancer?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Concept of Sentinel Lymph Node:</strong></p>
        <p>It has been demonstrated that there are usually <strong>one or two nodes that are the first nodes draining the breast</strong>. It appears that, if these nodes are identified and removed, they are <strong>predictive for the rest of the axilla</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Identification Technique:</strong></p>
        <p>They are identified preoperatively by using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A special <strong>blue dye</strong> and/or</li>
          <li><strong>Radioactive technetium sulphur colloid</strong> and a modified directional Geiger counter</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Clinical Decision Making:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If <strong>lymph node involvement is demonstrated</strong> following sentinel node biopsy, then:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Axillary radiotherapy</strong> is given to help control axillary nodal metastasis, OR</li>
              <li>An <strong>axillary clearance</strong> is performed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Both axillary radiotherapy and axillary lymph node clearance have <strong>lymphoedema as a potential side effect</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoids unnecessary <strong>axillary clearance</strong> in patients with negative sentinel nodes</li>
          <li>Reduces risk of <strong>lymphoedema</strong> and other complications associated with axillary surgery</li>
          <li>Provides accurate <strong>staging information</strong> for treatment planning</li>
          <li>Allows focused treatment only for those who need it (sentinel node positive patients)</li>
