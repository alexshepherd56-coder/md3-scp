    <h1>Case 25.3 – Drug Seeking Patient</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Mental Health and Human Behaviour | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Psychiatry | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Jack Archer, 22 years old as a waiter at the local RSL club who is an inconsistent attendee at your practice. He had a history of substance use and usually requests medical certificates to cover his work absences from work. He is often disruptive in the waiting room, and he tends to become demanding with staff if he is not seen within 30 minutes of arrival. Some staff members, find him difficult while others feel sorry for him. They are generally afraid he will threaten to take his own life if his wishes are not met (as he has often done this in the past). He has not had a diagnosis of any mental health problem.</p>

    <p>Now, Jack presents requesting a prescription for alprazolam. He says he visited the hospital ED who recommended alprazolam for anxiety but lost his discharge note.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. How would you respond to Jack's request for alprazolam? What further questions would you ask and what information would you seek?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Responding to the Request:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take focus off the drugs and back to his anxiety symptoms</li>
          <li>Try to stay calm and speak in a clear and unhurried manner</li>
          <li>Explain you would be happy to help Jack with his symptoms, but first need to ask him a few questions to determine what is going on</li>
          <li>Explain that you need to do this to ensure that the treatment you provide him with is the right treatment, and will help him with his symptoms</li>
          <li>State that at the moment you are not able to write him a script for alprazolam, but perhaps after assessing him you will be able to help him</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Further Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to establish a rapport with Jack</li>
          <li>Try to determine what Jack's symptoms are</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any current or past substance abuse issues</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any signs of current intoxication</li>
          <li>If intoxicated or under the influence of a substance, ascertain what substance is involved</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has had alprazolam before, and what he has used it for</li>
          <li>Determine if Jack has any other reasons for coming in today</li>
          <li>Determine whether Jack has any safety concerns (i.e., is he at risk of harm to self or others)</li>
          <li>Ask about his claimed ED visit - when did he go, which hospital, what did they tell him?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Information to Seek:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check SafeScript / MyHealth Record</strong> to review his prescription history</li>
          <li>Contact the ED he claims to have visited to verify his story</li>
          <li>Review his medical records in your practice for patterns of behavior</li>
          <li>Check for any alerts or warnings from other staff members</li>
          <li>Conduct a risk assessment for substance misuse and dependence</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Safety Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure other staff members are aware that Jack is in your room</li>
          <li>Ensure there is an avenue of escape (i.e., don't allow Jack to sit between you and the door)</li>
          <li>Know where your duress button is</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>After your above assessment and discussion with Jack you decide not to prescribe him the alprazolam. He quickly becomes upset and agitated. He says he will not be able to cope without the medication, and that he may take his own life if you do not prescribe it. He says you will be found to be a negligent doctor if you do not prescribe the medication for him.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What is your differential diagnosis for Jack that would explain is history and current presentation?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>

          <li><strong>Personality disorder:</strong> Pattern of difficult interpersonal relationships, inconsistent attendance, disruptive behavior, boundary violations, splitting behavior with staff (some find him difficult, others feel sorry for him), manipulative use of suicide threats</li>
          <li><strong>Anxiety disorder:</strong> Generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder should be considered, though presentation suggests other diagnoses more likely</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustment disorder:</strong> Related to work or life stressors</li>
          <li><strong>Antisocial personality disorder:</strong> Pattern of disregard for rules, manipulative behavior, aggression</li>

          <li>Difficulty maintaining consistent relationships (inconsistent attendance, multiple work absences)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Red Flags for Drug-Seeking Behavior:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting specific controlled substances by name (alprazolam)</li>
          <li>Claiming to have lost prescriptions or discharge notes</li>
          <li>Vague or inconsistent history</li>
          <li>Becoming angry or threatening when request is denied</li>
          <li>Pattern of frequent attendance for similar complaints</li>
          <li>History of substance use</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. What strategies would you use to manage Jack's current behaviour in your office?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Immediate Strategies:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1. Maintain Safety</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your safety comes first</li>
          <li>Maintain awareness of exit routes</li>
          <li>Keep yourself between Jack and the door if possible (but don't physically block his exit)</li>
          <li>Know where your duress button is and be prepared to use it</li>
          <li>Consider having another staff member present</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. De-escalate (Firm but Calm)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay calm and maintain a non-threatening posture</li>
          <li>Speak slowly and clearly using simple statements</li>
          <li>Maintain appropriate distance - don't stand too close</li>
          <li>Acknowledge his distress: "I can see you're upset"</li>
          <li>Avoid arguing or becoming defensive</li>
          <li>Don't take hostile comments personally</li>
          <li>Use active listening - repeat back what he says to show you're hearing him</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Set Clear Boundaries</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain what is and isn't acceptable behavior in your practice</li>
          <li>Be specific: "I want to help you, but I need you to sit down and speak calmly"</li>
          <li>Outline consequences if boundaries are violated: "If you continue to shout, I will need to end this consultation"</li>
          <li>Be consistent in enforcing these boundaries</li>
          <li>Clarify that threatening behavior is not acceptable</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Arrange Appropriate Care</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take suicide threats seriously - conduct a risk assessment</li>
          <li>If genuine risk of self-harm: consider Mental Health Act provisions</li>
          <li>If drug-seeking behavior: offer appropriate alternatives (referral to addiction services, non-addictive anxiety treatments)</li>
          <li>Provide information about crisis services</li>
          <li>Offer a follow-up appointment to discuss his concerns when he is calmer</li>
          <li><strong>Important:</strong> Never physically block an exit - this can escalate the situation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Communication Strategies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Validate his feelings without agreeing to inappropriate requests</li>
          <li>Explain your clinical reasoning for not prescribing alprazolam</li>
          <li>Discuss alternative treatment options</li>
          <li>Document the interaction thoroughly</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If He Begins to Calm Down:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let him cool off</li>
          <li>Offer a glass of water or tea to show you understand he's distressed and you're willing to try again</li>
          <li>Reinforce that you want to help him but need him to engage appropriately</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>Unfortunately, despite the above strategies, Jack storms out of your office and pushes past one of your colleagues in the corridor causing him to fall into the wall. Jack yells, "Get out of the way," and holds up his fists like he is going to punch someone.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. How would you manage Jack's current violent behaviour?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>

          <li>Your safety and staff safety is the priority</li>
          <li>Ensure other patients are safe and moved away from the situation</li>

          <li>Call for help from other staff</li>

          <li>If he sits down, maintain distance and wait for emergency services</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>After the Incident:</strong></p>

          <li>Debrief with staff</li>
          <li>Access support services if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Document exact sequence of events</li>
          <li>Note who witnessed the violence</li>
          <li>Document any injuries</li>
          <li>Record what was said and done</li>
          <li>Preserve any CCTV footage</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>Jack has now left the practice, but everyone is feeling threatened by Jack.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. How will you manage this situation going forward? Think about whether you will keep Jack as a patient, and if not, how would you manage this? Is there anyone else you should inform?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Immediate Actions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Debrief with all staff members who witnessed or were involved in the incident</li>
          <li>Provide support to the colleague who was physically assaulted</li>
          <li>Ensure all staff feel safe and supported</li>
          <li>Consider providing access to counseling services for affected staff</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Decision About Continuing Care:</strong></p>
        <p>Given the violent behavior and assault on staff, strong consideration should be given to terminating the doctor-patient relationship:</p>

        <p><strong>Reasons to Terminate:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical violence toward staff member</li>
          <li>Threatening behavior</li>
          <li>Staff safety concerns</li>
          <li>Breakdown of therapeutic relationship</li>
          <li>Pattern of manipulative and disruptive behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If Deciding to Terminate the Relationship:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide written notification to Jack (send via registered mail)</li>
          <li>Clearly document reasons (assault, threatening behavior, safety concerns)</li>
          <li>State that he is no longer welcome at the practice</li>
          <li>Provide list of alternative providers if possible (though not required given safety concerns)</li>
          <li>Offer to provide ongoing care for a very limited transition period (e.g., 7-14 days) for urgent medical needs only, with conditions (must be calm, must not be alone with doctor)</li>
          <li>Make clear that police will be called if he returns to the practice</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If Deciding to Continue Care (Less Recommended):</strong></p>
        <p>If the practice decides to continue treating Jack, strict conditions must be in place:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Written behavioral contract</li>
          <li>Warning systems in place for all staff</li>
          <li>Flag in patient record system</li>
          <li>Never see him alone - always have another staff member present</li>
          <li>Security arrangements</li>
          <li>Clear boundaries about acceptable behavior</li>
          <li>Immediate termination if boundaries violated again</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Who to Inform:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Police:</strong> Should already be informed about the assault - ensure formal report is filed</li>
          <li><strong>Practice manager/owner:</strong> Full incident report</li>
          <li><strong>Medical defense organization:</strong> Seek advice about the situation</li>
          <li><strong>All practice staff:</strong> Warn about patient, share his photo if available, implement alert system</li>
          <li><strong>Building security:</strong> If practice is in a larger building</li>
          <li><strong>Other practices in area:</strong> Consider warning (with legal advice about privacy implications)</li>
          <li><strong>Medical Board:</strong> If Jack carries through on threats to make complaints</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Safety Measures Going Forward:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Issue a restraining order/trespass notice</li>
          <li>Document that will ban patient from the practice</li>
          <li>Alert reception staff - provide photo if available</li>
          <li>Instructions to reception: if Jack appears, call police immediately, do not engage</li>
          <li>Review practice security measures</li>
          <li>Consider panic buttons, security cameras, security guard if needed</li>
          <li>Review and update workplace violence policy</li>
          <li>Provide staff training on managing aggressive patients</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comprehensive incident report</li>
          <li>Detailed medical records of all interactions</li>
          <li>Copy of letter terminating relationship</li>
          <li>Record of all notifications made</li>
          <li>Witness statements from staff</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Legal Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to refuse to treat a patient who has been violent</li>
          <li>You have a duty of care to your staff</li>
          <li>Seek legal advice if uncertain</li>
          <li>Be prepared for possible complaint to medical board</li>
          <li>Ensure documentation is thorough and objective</li>
