    <h1>Case 29.6 – Vulval / Vaginal itch [SDL]</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Endocrine & Reproductive Symptoms | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Obstetrics & Gynaecology | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Angie Jones is a 38-year-old female who presents with itch and discomfort in her vaginal area. She experiences these symptoms often and they usually improve with clotrimazole cream.</p>

    <p>This is the first time she has had to see a doctor about the symptoms, she has already tried clotrimazole cream and it has not helped. The itch is 'driving her crazy' especially at night.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>VULVAL CANDIDIASIS</strong></p>

        <p><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong></p>
        <p>Irritation, 'cottage cheese' discharge</p>

        <p><strong>PATHOGENESIS</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Candida can reach the vagina via oral ingestion (it is not sexually transmitted, no need to treat partners)</li>
          <li>Infection almost always occurs in the insensitive vaginal lumen. The resulting 'burning' of the sensitive vulval epithelium is caused by the yeasts metabolites</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Treatment needs to be directed towards the vaginal source of the infection (applying anti-fungal cream to the vulva may be ineffective and worsen contact dermatitis)</li>
          <li>Swabbing as necessary is the only means of selecting appropriate treatment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid soap (replace with QV, sorbolene, saline)</li>
          <li>Do not use home remedies, over-the-counter preparations and non-prescribed medications</li>
          <li>Avoid artificial lubricants</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>SPECIFIC</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Imidazole cream, inserted nightly for 1 week</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>TINEA CRURIS</strong></p>

        <p><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This common world-wide ringworm affects the groin. Itchy erythematous plaques extend from the groin flexures on to the thighs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>PATHOGENESIS</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usually caused by <em>Trichophyton rubrum</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The diagnosis should be confirmed by skin scraping</li>
          <li>Treatment can be topical (terbinafine or miconazole cream) or systemic (terbinafine, griseofulvin or itraconazole).</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. Another frequent cause of recurrent vulval itch is genital herpes; outline the features of genital herpes under the following headings, clinical features, aetiology, pathogenesis and management.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Clinical features</strong></p>

        <p>First infections may be mild and unnoticed, but should lesions develop, the severity is generally greater than in recurrences.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Penile ulceration from herpetic infection (most frequent on the glans, foreskin and shaft of the penis). They are sore or painful and last for 2 to 3 weeks if untreated.</li>
          <li>Local lymph glands are enlarged and tender</li>
          <li>In women, lesions occur on the external genitalia and the mucosae of the vulva, vagina and cervix.</li>
          <li>Pain and difficulty passing urine are common.</li>
          <li>Flu-like symptoms with fever, headache and muscular aches. Symptoms tend to be more severe in women than in men.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following the initial infection immunity develops but does not fully protect against recurrence. Recurrences can be triggered by minor trauma, other infections, UV radiation, menstrual cycle (flare-ups may occur before the monthly period), emotional stress. Recurrent infections differ from first infections in that</p>

        <ul>
          <li>blisters are usually smaller in size and more closely grouped</li>
          <li>shorter duration than the initial infection, usually 5-10 days</li>
          <li>Generally the affected person feels quite well.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Itching or burning can precede by an hour or two the development of small, closely grouped blisters on a red base. These then produce shallow ulcers, on the glans or shaft of the penis in men and on the labia, vagina or cervix in women.</p>

        <p><strong>Aetiology</strong></p>

        <p>Herpes simplex is one of the commonest infections of mankind throughout the world. There are two main types of herpes simplex virus (HSV); type 1, which is mainly associated with facial infections and type 2, which is mainly genital, although there is considerable overlap.</p>

        <p>Both type 1 and type 2 herpes simplex viruses reside in a latent state in the nerves that supply sensation to the skin. With each episode of herpes simplex, the virus grows down the nerves and out into the skin or mucous membranes where it multiplies, causing the clinical lesion. After each episode it "dies back" up the nerve fibre and enters the resting state again.</p>

        <p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sexual contact, including oro-genital contact, is the most common way to transmit genital HSV infection. The virus can be shed in saliva and genital secretions from individuals, even if they have no symptoms, especially in the days and weeks following a clinical episode.</li>
          <li>Vertical transmission or auto inoculation may also occur.</li>
          <li>HSV dies quickly with drying at room temperature; spread from objects like bath towels (fomites) is unusual.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Management</strong></p>

        <p>Antiviral drugs are indicated for primary herpes simplex infection, as symptoms may last for 3 weeks if no treatment is given. Patients with significant recurrences may require repeated courses or continuous prophylactic therapy for 2 months or more. Mild uncomplicated recurrences of herpes simplex usually require no treatment.</p>

        <p>Available antiviral drugs include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acyclovir</li>
          <li>Valacyclovir</li>
          <li>Famciclovir</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. What are the clinical features seen in genital warts? Outline the aetiology, pathogenesis and management of genital warts.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Clinical features</strong></p>

        <p>Genital warts may occur in the following sites:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vulva</li>
          <li>Vagina</li>
          <li>Cervix</li>
          <li>Urethra</li>
          <li>Penis</li>
          <li>Scrotum</li>
          <li>Anus</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Aetiology</strong></p>

        <p>Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>There are at least 100 different types of HPV; at least 40 can infect the genital area.</li>
          <li>The HPV types that cause external visible warts (HPV Types 6 and 11) rarely cause cancer. Other HPV types (most often Types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35) are less common in visible warts but are strongly associated with penile and vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong></p>

        <p>Visible genital warts and subclinical HPV infection nearly always arise from direct skin to skin contact:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sexual contact. This is the most common way amongst adults.</li>
          <li>Oral sex</li>
          <li>Vertical transmission.</li>
          <li>Auto inoculation from one site to another.</li>
          <li>Controversy surrounds whether warts can be spread via fomites</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Transmission is common as genital warts often go unnoticed. Subclinical infections can also be infectious.</p>

        <p>Often, warts will appear three to six months after infection but latency periods of many months or even years have been reported. Developing genital warts during a long-term relationship does not necessarily imply infidelity.</p>

        <p>The risk of HPV transmission is extremely low if no warts recur a year after successful treatment.</p>

        <p>Condoms provide a physical barrier and lower the risk of passing on HPV. They do not, however, prevent all genital skin-to-skin contact.</p>

        <p>Use a condom to protect against other STIs, particularly with new sexual partners</p>

        <p><strong>Management</strong></p>

        <p>The underlying viral infection may or may not persist if the visible warts clear.</p>

        <p>If left untreated, warts may resolve, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number.</p>

        <p>No one treatment is ideal for everyone.</p>

        <p>Options include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No treatment at all.</li>
          <li>Podophyllotoxin solution or resin</li>
          <li>Imiquimod cream</li>
          <li>Cryotherapy</li>
          <li>Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)</li>
          <li>Diathermy</li>
          <li>Curettage</li>
          <li>Laser ablation</li>
          <li>5% fluorouracil cream</li>
        </ul>
