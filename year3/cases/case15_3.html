    <h1>Case 15.3 – Dementia</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Category:</strong> Mental Health and Human Behaviour | <strong>Discipline:</strong> Psychiatry | <strong>Setting:</strong> General Practice</p>

    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>Anthea Hardcastle presents with her 75-year-old mother Constance. She is concerned that her mother is 'losing it'. This is the second time in the last 2 weeks that she has arrived at her mother's place to find bathwater overflowing into the hallway. The carpet is now ruined and her mother cannot remember turning the taps on.</p>

    <p>Constance appears well, but she does not seem to think she has any problems. She acknowledges her memory is "not as good as it used to be", but thinks this is normal for anyone getting older. Constance feels her daughter is worrying over nothing.</p>

    <p>Anthea is concerned that her mother has dementia.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. Outline the key features of your history and examination that would assist in determining if Constance has dementia. What screening tools will be helpful in making the diagnosis?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>It is important to recognise the features of 'normal ageing' and the spectrum that ranges from mild cognitive impairment (CI) to dementia. Age-related mild CI (or age-associated memory impairment or age-related cognitive decline) refers to a syndrome that may predate the development of dementia. It describes a syndrome of objective memory impairment that does not significantly affect activities of daily living.</p>

        <p>The first step in evaluating a patient with memory complaints is deciding whether or not there is a cognitive impairment and if this impacts on their function. It is also important to differentiate between the '4 D's' of cognitive decline: Depression, delirium, dementia and normal age-related decline. The clinical examination must be focused on excluding a delirium or depression as a cause of the cognitive decline. <strong>The history is the most important part of assessing a patient for dementia.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Assess the degree of cognitive impairment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start in a non-confronting manner, asking where and when the patient was born; what school they attended; what work did they do; when the first child was born; then more specific questions, e.g., who is the prime minister? Current events or sporting results (if they are into sport) or favourite TV programs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Functional Assessment:</strong> the impact of cognitive impairment (collaborative history may be important here); managing finances; how do they manage their day (remember appointments, cooking, clothes washing, take medications, any problems with behaviour, dressing, showering).</p>

        <p><strong>Objective evaluation: Screening tests</strong> (Typical early changes of dementia include recall and orientation difficulties):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MOCA (has more frontal lobe testing items than MMSE)</li>
          <li>MMSE</li>
          <li>Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS)</li>
          <li>The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>In your assessment, you find out that Constance's MOCA is 22; her memory is worsening and she often misplaces objects. She reports he mood is good and that she sleeping well. Constance says she is cooking her own meals, but collateral from her daughter is that there is often out of date food in the fridge, and Constance has lost 7 kg in the last 5 months. Constance has a cleaner who comes once a fortnight which is paid for privately. Her daughter Andrea is her main support. Constance spends most of her day at home on her own, but enjoys going out for walks in the morning around her neighbourhood.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. What further investigations would you undertake and why?</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Further investigations should focus on excluding reversible causes of cognitive impairment and identifying the type of dementia.</p>

        <p><strong>Investigations should include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full blood examination (FBE)</li>
          <li>Urea and electrolytes (U&Es)</li>
          <li>Liver function tests (LFTs)</li>
          <li>Thyroid function tests (TFTs)</li>
          <li>Vitamin B12 and folate levels</li>
          <li>Calcium</li>
          <li>Glucose</li>
          <li>Syphilis serology (if clinically indicated)</li>
          <li>Neuroimaging (CT or MRI brain) to exclude structural lesions and assess for vascular changes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>As a result of your assessment and investigation findings you explain that Constance likely has Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br><br>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. Please outline your management plan for Constance using a biopsychosocial approach. Remember to assess her and manage any risks you have identified and to think about how to support her daughter.</strong><br>

        <p><strong>Non-pharmacological strategies</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Improve cognition:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Memory aids</li>
          <li>Problem solving</li>
          <li>Word games</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Preserve function and maintain safety:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recreational activities</li>
          <li>Exercise</li>
          <li>Multisensory stimulation</li>
          <li>Reminiscence therapy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Manage difficult behaviour:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Environmental changes</li>
          <li>Social interventions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pharmacological</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cholinesterase inhibitors</strong> - for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease</li>
          <li><strong>Memantine</strong> - for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before starting cholinesterase inhibitors (ChI) or memantine, review current medications to identify drugs that may exacerbate the patient's clinical condition or that could interact with ChIs.</p>

        <p><strong>Other management strategies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make contact with Alzheimer's Australia early while memory is improved</li>
          <li>Home support networks</li>
          <li>Occupational therapy assessment to ensure safety in the home, minimise risk of falls, etc.</li>
          <li>Establish good behaviours to keep the patient safe and at home (Keeping a calendar or diary and reading it every morning; using a blister pack; paying bills as soon as they arrive; giving up the drivers licence; giving up use of a gas stove and using a microwave; learning to use speed dial on the phone; preventing malnutrition – e.g. meal delivery)</li>
          <li>When dysfunction has been established, important to identify causes as this gives an indication of prognosis, although coexistence of several types is common (e.g., vascular and Alzheimer's) and has treatment implications for treatment. Alzheimer's disease (65%), Vascular dementia (15%), Dementia with Lewy Body (10%), Frontotemporal dementia (5%), Dementia of Parkinson's, Alcohol dementia, other</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Prognosis and treatment efficacy:</strong></p>
        <p>The rapidity of progression is generally unpredictable. However, in broad terms, the time of diagnosis to death in Alzheimer's is about 10 years; Lewy body dementia is more rapid, and frontotemporal dementia is more rapid again.</p>

        <p>The benefit of treatment with ChI's varies according to the type of dementia. Treatment of people with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease for 6 months improves cognition scores an average of 2-3 points compared with placebo. There is insufficient evidence for the use of ChI's inhibitors in Lewy body dementia so there is no PBS use for this. In patients with vascular dementia the most important management step is to control the vascular risk factors and, if safe, use aspirin. There is no support for the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in frontotemporal dementia.</p>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. Anthea is concerned about her mother continuing to live on her own, but is not sure what she should do. Explain the role of multidisciplinary aged care assessment teams in this clinical context, and discuss what options are available to Constance.</strong><br>
      <button class="toggle">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>As a dementia advances, families will require access and referral to community or dementia specific aged care packages for assistance with personal care, meals, medication monitoring and domestic cleaning. Families may also need to consider respite or full-time placement for the person with dementia.</p>

        <p><strong>Services available to help relatives of patient with Dementia:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>NSW dementia Behaviours Management Advisory Service (DBMAS)</strong> is a service offering 24 hour assistance for people who care for patients with dementia</li>
          <li><strong>National Dementia Helpline</strong> 100 100 500</li>
          <li><strong>Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT)</strong> - Multidisciplinary teams that assess eligibility for government-funded aged care services</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Options available to Constance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Home care packages (varying levels of support from basic to comprehensive)</li>
          <li>Community aged care packages</li>
          <li>Dementia-specific aged care packages</li>
          <li>Respite care (to provide relief for carers)</li>
          <li>Full-time residential aged care placement (if required as disease progresses)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) plays a crucial role in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comprehensive assessment of the person's needs</li>
          <li>Determining eligibility for government-funded aged care services</li>
          <li>Recommending appropriate level and type of care</li>
          <li>Coordinating care plans with multiple service providers</li>
          <li>Supporting both the patient and family/carers</li>
        </ul>
